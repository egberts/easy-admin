# easy-admin
These scripts are for easy Debian system administration. 

Scripts that helps white-lab managers. Also bare-metal configurators, test jockeys, cloud virtualizers, network grokkers, and home-bounded computer scientists.

You installed a package using one of those distro package tools. They didn't configure your box correctly or it was barely usable at "basic settings".

Now we have these bash scripts, that takes you even further in customization.

You run them,
it looks at what kind of OS and network interfaces you have,
it asks you a few questions, warns you of poor choices,
securely writes the configuration files, perfectly so,
and starts your services...

Only the way you dictate them.

* No more accidental security vulnerabilities,
* No network holes,
* No hacked box,
* No more guessing nor remembering settings of many unintelligible keywords.
* often better than (or at a least equal to) CISecurity

Read and answer the questions; then be up and running.
