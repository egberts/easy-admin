Scripts for easy system administration

Imagine that you installed a package using one of those distro package tool, they didnt 
configure it right or it was at "basic settings".

Now we have these bash scripts that will look at your setup and ask some intelligent 
questions before writing all the necessary config settings ... for you.

You run them,
it looks at what kind of OS and network interfaces you have,
it asks you a few questions,
writes the configuration files ... securely,
and starts your services...

Just the way you want them.

* No more accidential security vulnerabilities,
* No network holes,
* No hacked box,
* No more guessing nor remembering settings of zillion things.

Just read the questions, be done; up and running.
