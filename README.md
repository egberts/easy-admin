# easy-admin
Scripts to easy system administration for white-lab managers, bare-metal configurators, test jockeys, cloud virtualizers, network grokkers, and home-bounded computer scientists.

Imagine that you installed a package using one of those distro package tool, they didnt 
configure it right or it was just barely usable at "basic settings".

Now we have these bash scripts, that takes you even further in customization.

You run them,
it looks at what kind of OS and network interfaces you have,
it asks you a few questions,
writes the configuration files ... securely, perfectly so,
and starts your services...

Just the way you want them.

* No more accidential security vulnerabilities,
* No network holes,
* No hacked box,
* No more guessing nor remembering settings of zillion things.
* often better than (or at a minimum equal to) CISecurity

Just read and answer the questions, be done; up and running.
