###############################################################################
# 
# Entries in this file define the bandwidth for interfaces on which you want
# traffic shaping to be enabled.
# 
# If you do not plan to use traffic shaping for a device, don't put it in here as
# it limits the throughput of that device to the limits you set here.
# 
# A note on the bandwidth definitions used in this file:
# 
#   ● don't use a space between the integer value and the unit: 30kbit is valid
#     while 30 kbit is not.
# 
#   ● you can use one of the following units:
# 
#     kbps
# 
#         Kilobytes per second.
# 
#     mbps
# 
#         Megabytes per second.
# 
#     kbit
# 
#         Kilobits per second.
# 
#     mbit
# 
#         Megabits per second.
# 
#     bps or number
# 
#         Bytes per second.
# 
#   ● Only whole integers are allowed.
# 
# The columns in the file are as follows (where the column name is followed by a
# different name in parentheses, the different name is used in the alternate
# specification syntax).
# 
# INTERFACE - [number:]interface
# 
#     Name of interface. Each interface may be listed only once in this file. You
#     may NOT specify the name of an alias (e.g., eth0:0) here; see http://
#     www.shorewall.net/FAQ.htm#faq18
# 
#     You may NOT specify wildcards here, e.g. if you have multiple ppp
#     interfaces, you need to put them all in here!
# 
#     If the device doesn't exist, a warning message will be issued during
#     "shorewall [re]start" and "shorewall refresh" and traffic shaping
#     configuration will be skipped for that device.
# 
#     Shorewall assigns a sequential interface number to each interface (the
#     first entry in the file is interface 1, the second is interface 2 and so
#     on) You can explicitly specify the interface number by prefixing the
#     interface name with the number and a colon (":"). Example: 1:eth0.
# 
# IN-BANDWIDTH (in_bandwidth) - {-|bandwidth[:burst]|~bandwidth[:interval:
#     decay_interval]}
# 
#     The incoming bandwidth of that interface. Please note that you are not able
#     to do traffic shaping on incoming traffic, as the traffic is already
#     received before you could do so. But this allows you to define the maximum
#     traffic allowed for this interface in total, if the rate is exceeded, the
#     packets are dropped. You want this mainly if you have a DSL or Cable
#     connection to avoid queuing at your providers side.
# 
#     If you don't want any traffic to be dropped, set this to a value to zero in
#     which case Shorewall will not create an ingress qdisc.Must be set to zero
#     if the REDIRECTED INTERFACES column is non-empty.
# 
#     The optional burst option was added in Shorewall 4.4.18. The default burst
#     is 10kb. A larger burst can help make the bandwidth more accurate; often
#     for fast lines, the enforced rate is well below the specified bandwidth.
# 
#     What is described above creates a rate/burst policing filter. Beginning
#     with Shorewall 4.4.25, a rate-estimated policing filter may be configured
#     instead. Rate-estimated filters should be used with Ethernet adapters that
#     have Generic Receive Offload enabled by default. See Shorewall FAQ 97a.
# 
#     To create a rate-estimated filter, precede the bandwidth with a tilde
#     ("~"). The optional interval and decay_interval determine how often the
#     rate is estimated and how many samples are retained for estimating. Please
#     see http://ace-host.stuart.id.au/russell/files/tc/doc/estimators.txt for
#     details.
# 
# OUT-BANDWIDTH (out_bandwidth) - bandwidth
# 
#     The outgoing bandwidth of that interface. This is the maximum speed your
#     connection can handle. It is also the speed you can refer as "full" if you
#     define the tc classes in shorewall-tcclasses(5). Outgoing traffic above
#     this rate will be dropped.
# 
# OPTIONS - {-|{classify|htb|hfsc|linklayer={ethernet|atm|adsl}|tsize=tsize|mtu=
#     mtu|mpu=mpu|overhead=overhead} ,...}
# 
#     classify ― When specified, Shorewall will not generate tc or Netfilter
#     rules to classify traffic based on packet marks. You must do all
#     classification using CLASSIFY rules in shorewall-mangle(5).
# 
#     htb - Use the Hierarchical Token Bucket queuing discipline. This is the
#     default.
# 
#     hfsc - Shorewall normally uses the Hierarchical Token Bucket queuing
#     discipline. When hfsc is specified, the Hierarchical Fair Service Curves
#     discipline is used instead (see tc-hfsc (7)).
# 
#     linklayer - Added in Shorewall 4.5.6. Type of link (ethernet, atm, adsl).
#     When specified, causes scheduler packet size manipulation as described in
#     tc-stab (8). When this option is given, the following options may also be
#     given after it:
# 
#         mtu=mtu - The device MTU; default 2048 (will be rounded up to a power
#         of two)
# 
#         mpu=mpubytes - Minimum packet size used in calculations. Smaller
#         packets will be rounded up to this size
# 
#         tsize=tablesize - Size table entries; default is 512
# 
#         overhead=overheadbytes - Number of overhead bytes per packet.
# 
# REDIRECTED INTERFACES (redirect)- [interface[,interface]...]
# 
#     May only be specified if the interface in the INTERFACE column is an
#     Intermediate Frame Block (IFB) device. Causes packets that enter each
#     listed interface to be passed through the egress filters defined for this
#     device, thus providing a form of incoming traffic shaping. When this column
#     is non-empty, the classify option is assumed.
# 
# Examples
# 
# Example 1:
# 
#     Suppose you are using PPP over Ethernet (DSL) and ppp0 is the interface for
#     this. The device has an outgoing bandwidth of 500kbit and an incoming
#     bandwidth of 6000kbit
