?FORMAT 2

-       lo      -

# internet has the following:
#    dhcp - the interface gets its IP address via DHCP LAN segment 
#    logmartians - Turn on kernel martian logging (logging of 
#                      packets with impossible source addresses.
#    routeback - indicates that Shorewall should include rules that 
#                    allow traffic arriving on this interface to 
#                    be routed back out that same interface.
#    routefilter - Turn on kernel route filtering for this 
#                      interface (anti-spoofing measure).
#    nosmurfs - Filter packets for smurfs (packets with a 
#                   broadcast address as the source).
#    tcpflags - Packets arriving on this interface are checked 
#                   for certain illegal combinations of TCP flags. 
#    upnp - Incoming requests from this interface may be remapped 
#                   via UPNP (upnpd).

# green has the following:
#    dhcp - the interface is used by a DHCP server running on the firewall
#    logmartians - Turn on kernel martian logging (logging of 
#                      packets with impossible source addresses.

# vmnet has the following:
#    bridge - Designates the interface as a bridge. 
#                 Setting this option also sets routeback.
#    dhcp - the interface has a static IP but is on a LAN segment 
#               with lots of DHCP clients.
#    logmartians - Turn on kernel martian logging (logging of 
#                      packets with impossible source addresses.
#    routeback - indicates that Shorewall should include rules that 
#                    allow traffic arriving on this interface to 
#                    be routed back out that same interface.
