###############################################################################
# 
# This file lists the interfaces that are subject to simple traffic shaping.
# Simple traffic shaping is enabled by setting TC_ENABLED=Simple in
# shorewall.conf(5).
# 
# A note on the bandwidth definition used in this file:
# 
#   ● don't use a space between the integer value and the unit: 30kbit is valid
#     while 30 kbit is not.
# 
#   ● you can use one of the following units:
# 
#     kbps
# 
#         Kilobytes per second.
# 
#     mbps
# 
#         Megabytes per second.
# 
#     kbit
# 
#         Kilobits per second.
# 
#     mbit
# 
#         Megabits per second.
# 
#     bps or number
# 
#         Bytes per second.
# 
#     k or kb
# 
#         Kilo bytes.
# 
#     m or mb
# 
#         Megabytes.
# 
#   ● Only whole integers are allowed.
# 
# The columns in the file are as follows (where the column name is followed by a
# different name in parentheses, the different name is used in the alternate
# specification syntax).
# 
# INTERFACE
# 
#     The logical name of an interface. If you run both IPv4 and IPv6 Shorewall
#     firewalls, a given interface should only be listed in one of the two
#     configurations.
# 
# TYPE - [external|internal]
# 
#     Optional. If given specifies whether the interface is external (facing
#     toward the Internet) or internal (facing toward a local network) and
#     enables SFQ flow classification.
# 
# IN-BANDWIDTH (in_bandwidth) - {-|bandwidth[:burst]|~bandwidth[:interval:
#     decay_interval]}
# 
#     The incoming bandwidth of that interface. Please note that you are not able
#     to do traffic shaping on incoming traffic, as the traffic is already
#     received before you could do so. But this allows you to define the maximum
#     traffic allowed for this interface in total, if the rate is exceeded, the
#     packets are dropped. You want this mainly if you have a DSL or Cable
#     connection to avoid queuing at your providers side.
# 
#     If you don't want any traffic to be dropped, set this to a value to zero in
#     which case Shorewall will not create an ingress qdisc.Must be set to zero
#     if the REDIRECTED INTERFACES column is non-empty.
# 
#     The optional burst option was added in Shorewall 4.4.18. The default burst
#     is 10kb. A larger burst can help make the bandwidth more accurate; often
#     for fast lines, the enforced rate is well below the specified bandwidth.
# 
#     What is described above creates a rate/burst policing filter. Beginning
#     with Shorewall 4.4.25, a rate-estimated policing filter may be configured
#     instead. Rate-estimated filters should be used with Ethernet adapters that
#     have Generic Receive Offload enabled by default. See Shorewall FAQ 97a.
# 
#     To create a rate-estimated filter, precede the bandwidth with a tilde
#     ("~"). The optional interval and decay_interval determine how often the
#     rate is estimated and how many samples are retained for estimating. Please
#     see http://ace-host.stuart.id.au/russell/files/tc/doc/estimators.txt for
#     details.
# 
# OUT-BANDWIDTH (out_bandwidth) - [rate[:[burst][:[latency][:[peek][:[minburst
#     ]]]]]]
# 
#     Added in Shorewall 4.4.13. The terms are defined in tc-tbf(8).
# 
#     Shorewall provides defaults as follows:
# 
#     burst - 10kb
#     latency - 200ms
# 
#     The remaining options are defaulted by tc(8).
