# File: 60-ssl.conf
# Directory: /etc/lighttpd/conf.d
# Title: HTTPS setup
# Description:
# All three settings cannot be empty strings. Empty "" will cause parsing errors.
#
# --- Notes:
# 1. All ssl.* global variables must be assigned only once outside conditionals.
# 2. Use $SERVER["socket"] or $HTTP["host"] for per-site overrides.
# 3. Ensure PEM files are readable by the lighttpd process (www-data/lighttpd/http user).
# 4. OCSP stapling and client cert verification require valid certificate files.




# Module require: mod_openssl
server.modules += ( "mod_openssl" )

# ssl.engine
#
# Purpose: Enables or disables SSL/TLS support in Lighttpd.
#
# Type: String: "enable" or "disable".
#
# Usage Example:
#    ssl.engine = "enable"
#
# Meaning:
#
#   - "enable" - Lighttpd listens for HTTPS connections
#                and uses the SSL/TLS module.
#
#   - "disable" - SSL is turned off; only HTTP (non-encrypted) is served.
#
# Notes:
#   - Requires mod_openssl or mod_ssl to be loaded in server.modules.
#   - Cannot be empty (""), or parsing will fail.
#
ssl.engine = "disable"


# ssl.pemfile
#
# Purpose: Specifies the server certificate and private key file for HTTPS.
#
# Type: Path to a PEM file containing the certificate + private key.
#
# Usage Example:
#     ssl.pemfile = "/etc/ssl/private/lighttpd.pem"
#
# Meaning:
#
#     The PEM file should contain the server’s certificate
#     first, then the private key.
#
# Used for terminating HTTPS connections.
#
# Notes:
#   - If the PEM file is missing, Lighttpd fails to start.
#   - File must be readable by the Lighttpd process user
#     (commonly www-data, lighttpd, or http, depending on distro).
#
ssl.pemfile = ""

# ssl.ca-file
#
# Purpose: Optional file containing one or more CA
#          certificates to verify client certificates 
#          (for mutual TLS) or chain verification.
#
# Type: Path to PEM-encoded CA certificate(s).
#
# Usage Example:
#    ssl.ca-file = "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt"
# Meaning:
#  - Provides a trusted CA list for client certificate verification.
#  - Required only if you enable client certificate
#    authentication (ssl.verifyclient.activate = "enable").
#
# Notes:
#  - Can be omitted if no client certificate verification is needed.
#  - Must be readable by the Lighttpd process.
#
ssl.ca-file = "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"
