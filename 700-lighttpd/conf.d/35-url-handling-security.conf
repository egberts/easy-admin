# Title: Access restrictions and index control.
# Description:
#    Control basic directory access and default document
#    behavior, crucial for security and proper serving
#    of content.


# url.access-deny
#
# Purpose: Prevents direct HTTP access to files or
#          directories matching the specified patterns.
#
# Type: Array of strings. Each string is either a
#       filename, file extension, or regex-like
#       pattern (starting with ~).
# Denied files return HTTP 403 Forbidden.
#
# Can be used globally or inside $HTTP["host"] / $HTTP["url"] blocks.
#
url.access-deny = ( "~", "~*", ".inc", ".db" )

# dir-listing.activate
# Purpose: Controls whether Lighttpd automatically generates
#          a directory listing when no index file is present.
# Type: "enable" or "disable"
#   - "enable" - If a client requests a directory without an index
#                file, Lighttpd generates an HTML directory listing.
#
#   - "disable" - Directory requests without an index file
#                 return HTTP 403 Forbidden (more secure).
#
# Often disabled on production servers to prevent accidental
# disclosure of directory contents.
#
# Can be overridden per $HTTP["url"] or $HTTP["host"].
#
# The array order determines which file is preferred.
#
# Can include PHP front controllers (index.php) if using FastCGI/PHP.
#
dir-listing.activate = "disable"

# index-file.names
# Purpose: Specifies the list of filenames Lighttpd will
#          look for when serving a directory request.
#
# Type: Array of strings.
#
index-file.names = ( "index.html" )

# index-file.names = ( .html", "index.htm", "default.htm", "index.php" )
