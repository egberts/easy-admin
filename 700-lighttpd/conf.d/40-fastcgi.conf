# Title: Dynamic content handling (CGI/FastCGI/Proxy)
# Description:
# Both fastcgi.server and cgi.assign are mappings, not strings.
#
# Empty strings ("") are invalid and will trigger parser errors.
#
# Typically, fastcgi.server is used for PHP/FastCGI apps;
# cgi.assign is only needed for traditional CGI scripts.
#
# These directives are ignored unless mod_fastcgi or
# mod_cgi is loaded, respectively.


# fastcgi.server
#
# Purpose: Configures FastCGI backends to handle dynamic
#    content (PHP, Python, Ruby, or other FastCGI-capable
#    applications).
#
# Type: A mapping (array) of URI patterns → FastCGI backend definitions.
#
# Syntax Example (PHP-FPM):
#
#    fastcgi.server = (
#        ".php" => ((
#            "socket" => "/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock",
#            "broken-scriptfilename" => "enable",
#            "check-local" => "disable"
#        ))
#    )
# Field meanings:
#    ".php"      URI pattern that triggers FastCGI handling.
#    "socket"    Path to the FastCGI server socket (Unix or TCP).
#    "broken-scriptfilename"    Compatibility option for some PHP-FPM setups.
#    "check-local"    Whether to check if the file exists before
#                     forwarding; "disable" avoids 404 checks
#                     at Lighttpd level.
#
# Multiple backends can be defined per URI pattern
# (e.g., for load balancing).
#
# The mapping must be a non-empty array, assigning
# FastCGI configuration per file extension or URL path.
#
# An empty string ("") is invalid and will fail parsing.

# cgi.assign
# Purpose: Maps file extensions to external CGI 
#          executables for executing dynamic scripts.
#
# Type: Mapping (array) of extension → executable path.
#
# Example syntax:
#     cgi.assign = (
#        ".pl" => "/usr/bin/perl",
#        ".py" => "/usr/bin/python3",
#        ".sh" => "/bin/bash"
#     )
#
# Meaning:
#
#   Extension	Effect
#     .pl    Files ending with .pl are executed using /usr/bin/perl.
#     .py    Files ending with .py are executed using /usr/bin/python3.
#     .sh    Files ending with .sh are executed using /bin/bash.
#
# Notes:
#
# Only used if mod_cgi is loaded.
#
# CGI scripts are executed by the server directly;
# FastCGI is preferred for high-performance dynamic content.
#
# Assignments must be a non-empty mapping, not an empty string ("").
#
cgi.assign = ""
