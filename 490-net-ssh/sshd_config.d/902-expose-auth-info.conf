# Title: Expose the Authentication Methods Used
# Description:
#
#   'ExposeAuthInfo' writes a temporary file containing a
#   list of authentication methods and public
#   credentials (e.g. keys) used to authenticate the
#   user.
#
#   The location of the file is exposed to the
#   user session through the SSH_USER_AUTH environment
#   variable.
#
#   Default filepath is /tmp/sshauth.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
#   where XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is an actual character sequence
#   used by tmpfile() for replacement with random characters.
#
#   'ExposeAuthInfo' defaults to 'no'.
#
