# Title: Rekey the Ciphers at Specified Interval
# Description:
#
#   'RekeyLimit' specifies the maximum amount of data
#   that may be transmitted before the session key is
#   renegotiated, optionally followed a maximum
#   amount of time that may pass before the session
#   key is renegotiated.
#
#   The first argument is specified in bytes and may
#   have a suffix of ‘K’, ‘M’, or ‘G’ to indicate
#   Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively.
#
#   The default is between ‘1G’ and ‘4G’, depending on
#   the cipher.
#
#   The optional second value is specified in seconds
#   and may use any of the units documented in the
#   TIME FORMATS section.
#
#   'RekeyLimit' defaults to 'none'.
#
