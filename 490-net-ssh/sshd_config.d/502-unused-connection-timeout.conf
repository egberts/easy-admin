# Title: Unused Connection Timeouts
# Description:
#
#   'UnusedConnectionTimeout' specifies whether and how
#   quickly sshd(8) should close client connections with
#   no open channels.
#
#   Open channels include active shell, command execution
#   or subsystem sessions, connected network, socket,
#   agent or X11 forwardings.
#
#   Forwarding listeners, such as those from the
#   ssh(1) -R flag, are not considered as open channels and
#   do not prevent the timeout. The timeout value is
#   specified in seconds or may use any of the units
#   documented in the TIME FORMATS section.
#
#   NOTE: that this timeout starts when the client connection
#         completes user authentication but before the client has an
#         opportunity to open any channels. Caution should be used
#         when using short timeout values, as they may not provide
#         sufficient time for the client to request and open its
#         channels before terminating the connection.
#
#   The default 'none' is to never expire connections for having
#   no open channels. This option may be useful in conjunction
#   with ChannelTimeout.
