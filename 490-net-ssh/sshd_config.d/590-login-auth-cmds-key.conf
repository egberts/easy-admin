# Title: What to Execute to Obtain an Authorized Pubkey
# Description:
#
#   AuthorizedKeysCommand specifies a program to be 
#   used to look up the user's public keys.
#
#   The program must be owned by root, not writable by
#   group or others and specified by an absolute path.
#
#   Arguments to AuthorizedKeysCommand accept the tokens
#   described in the TOKENS section of sshd_config(5)
#   man page.  
#
#   If no arguments are specified then the username 
#   of the target user is used.
#
#   The program should produce on standard output zero
#   or more lines of authorized_keys output (see
#   AUTHORIZED_KEYS in sshd(8)).  
#
#   If a key supplied by AuthorizedKeysCommand does 
#   not successfully authenticate and authorize the 
#   user then public key authentication continues 
#   using the usual AuthorizedKeysFile files.  
#
#   By default, no AuthorizedKeysCommand is run.
#
#   Arguments to the AuthorizedKeysCommand accepts 
#   the following tokens:
#
#       %%, %f, %h, %k, %t, %U, and %u
#
#   AuthorizedKeysCommand defaults to 'none'.
#
#   Valid values are: 'none', '', and a command line.
#
# NOTE: 'AuthorizedKeysCommand' keyword is most 
#       useful for looking up from a repository of 
#       centralized public keys whose SSH session 
#       are authorized to be used by this sshd(8) 
#       daemon.
#
#       Its only burden is that it cannot handle
#       the expiration of public key unless suitable
#       backend (out-of-band) support is provided into 
#       keeping such centralized repository (of 
#       public keys) up to date.
#
#       This keyword is useful for small network and
#       small installations.
