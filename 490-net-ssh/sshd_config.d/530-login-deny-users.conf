# Title: Deny a list of users
# Description:
#
#   'DenyUsers' keyword can be followed by a list of user
#   name patterns, separated by spaces.  Login is
#   disallowed for user names that match one of the
#   patterns.  Only user names are valid; a numerical
#   user ID is not recognized.  By default, login is
#   allowed for all users.  If the pattern takes the
#   form USER@HOST then USER and HOST are separately
#   checked, restricting logins to particular users from
#   particular hosts.  HOST criteria may additionally
#   contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen
#   format.  The allow/deny directives are processed in
#   the following order: 
#
#       DenyUsers, 
#       AllowUsers,
#       DenyGroups, and finally 
#       AllowGroups.
#
# 'DenyUsers' default is not to use its keyword.
