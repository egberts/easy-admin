# Title: Which username To Run As When Checking Authorized Pubkeys
# Description:
#
#   AuthorizedKeysCommandUser specifies the user under
#   whose account the AuthorizedKeysCommand is run.
#
#   It is recommended to use a dedicated user that has
#   no other role on the host than running authorized
#   keys commands.  
#
#   If AuthorizedKeysCommand is specified but 
#   AuthorizedKeysCommandUser is not, then
#   sshd(8) will refuse to start.
#
#   AuthorizedKeysCommandUser default is not to 
#   use its keyword.
