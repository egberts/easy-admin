# Description:
#
#   'ClientAliveInterval' sets a timeout interval in
#   seconds after which if no data has been received
#   from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through
#   the encrypted channel to request a response from the
#   client.
#
#   'ClientAliveInterval' defaults to '0', indicating that
#   these messages will not be sent to the client.
#
# CLI option: -o ClientAliveInterval=0
