# Title: System logging facility selection
# Description:
#
#   'SyslogFacility' gives the facility code that is used
#   when logging messages from sshd(8).
#
#   Syntax usage:
#
#     SyslogFacility <facility-label>
#
#   The possible <facility-label> values are:
#
#     DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1,
#     LOCAL2, LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.
#
#   'SyslogFacility' defaults to 'AUTH'.
#
#   The selected facility determines log routing, storage, and
#   access controls as configured by the system logging daemon.
#
#   Warnings:
#     - Using a shared facility (e.g., USER) may intermix sshd
#       logs with unrelated processes.
#     - AUTHPRIV is recommended for production systems to
#       restrict log visibility.
