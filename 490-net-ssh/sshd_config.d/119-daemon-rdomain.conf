# Title: Routing Domain
# Description:
#
#   'RDomain' specifies an explicit routing domain that
#   is applied after authentication has completed.
#   The user session, as well and any forwarded or
#   listening IP sockets, will be bound to this
#   rdomain(4).
#
#   If the routing domain is set to %D, then the
#   domain in which the incoming connection was
#   received will be applied.
#
#   'RDomain' accepts the token %D, 'none', or
#   a valid domain.
#
#   'RDomain' defaults to 'none'.
#
# CLI option: -o RDomain=none
# CLI option: -o RDomain=<top-level-domain>
