# Title: Concurrent unauthenticated connection limits
# Description:
#
#   'MaxStartups' specifies the maximum number of
#   concurrent unauthenticated connections to the
#   SSH daemon.
#
#   Additional connections will be dropped until
#   authentication succeeds or the 'LoginGraceTime'
#   expires for a connection.
#
#   'MaxStartups' defaults to '10:30:100'.
#
#   Alternatively, random early drop can be enabled
#   by specifying the three colon separated values
#   start:rate:full (e.g. "10:30:60").
#
#   sshd(8) will refuse connection attempts with a
#   probability of rate/100 (30%) if there are
#   currently start (10) unauthenticated connections.
#
#   The probability increases linearly and all
#   connection attempts are refused if the number of
#   unauthenticated connections reaches full (60).
