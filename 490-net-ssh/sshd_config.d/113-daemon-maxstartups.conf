# MaxStartups specifies the maximum number of concurrent
# unauthenticated connections to the SSH daemon.
# Additional connections will be dropped until
# authentication succeeds or the LoginGraceTime expires
# for a connection.  The default is 10:30:100.
#
# Alternatively, random early drop can be enabled by
# specifying the three colon separated values
# start:rate:full (e.g. "10:30:60").  sshd(8) will
# refuse connection attempts with a probability of
# rate/100 (30%) if there are currently start (10)
# unauthenticated connections.  The probability
# increases linearly and all connection attempts are
# refused if the number of unauthenticated connections
# reaches full (60).
#
# CLI option: -o
# Process context: main()/server
# options.max_startups/server_accept_loop()/main()
# MaxStartups defaults to 10:30:100.
