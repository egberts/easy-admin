# Title: Maximum Concurrent Server Processes
# Description:
#
#   MaxStartups specifies the maximum number of 
#   concurrent unauthenticated connections to the 
#   SSH daemon. 
#   
#   Additional connections will be dropped until 
#   authentication succeeds or the LoginGraceTime 
#   expires for a connection.  
#  
#   MaxStartups defaults to 10:30:100.
#
#   Alternatively, random early drop can be enabled 
#   by specifying the three colon separated values 
#   start:rate:full (e.g. "10:30:60").  
#   
#   sshd(8) will refuse connection attempts with a 
#   probability of rate/100 (30%) if there are 
#   currently start (10) unauthenticated connections.  
#
#   The probability increases linearly and all 
#   connection attempts are refused if the number of 
#   unauthenticated connections reaches full (60).
