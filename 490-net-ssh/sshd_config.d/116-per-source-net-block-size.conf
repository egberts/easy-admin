# Title: Grouping Source IP Together
# Description:
#
#   'PerSourceNetBlockSize' directive implements
#   client address-based rate-limiting.
#
#   Specifies the number of bits of source address
#   that are grouped together for the purposes of
#   applying 'PerSourceMaxStartups' limits.
#
#   Values for IPv4 and optionally IPv6 may be
#   specified, separated by a colon.
#
#   The default is '32:128', which means each address
#   is considered individually.
#
#   Introduced in OpenSSH v8.5-p1
#
# CLI option: -oPerSourceNetBlockSize=32:128
