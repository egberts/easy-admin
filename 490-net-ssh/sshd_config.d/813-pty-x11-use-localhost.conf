# Title: X11 Use Localhost
# Description:
#
#   'X11UseLocalhost' specifies whether sshd(8) should bind
#   the X11 forwarding server to the loopback address or
#   to the wildcard address.  By default, sshd binds the
#   forwarding server to the loopback address and sets
#   the hostname part of the DISPLAY environment variable
#   to localhost.  This prevents remote hosts from
#   connecting to the proxy display.  However, some older
#   X11 clients may not function with this configuration.
#   X11UseLocalhost may be set to no to specify that the
#   forwarding server should be bound to the wildcard
#   address.  The argument must be yes or no.
#
#   'X11UseLocalhost' defaults to 'yes'.
#
