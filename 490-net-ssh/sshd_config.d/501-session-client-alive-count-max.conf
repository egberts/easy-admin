# Title: Maximum failed alive messages before a disconnection
# Description:
#
#   'ClientAliveCountMax' sets the number of client alive
#   messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving
#   any messages back from the client.
#
#   If this threshold is reached while client alive
#   messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the
#   client, terminating the session.
#
#   It is important to note that the use of client
#   alive messages is very different from 'TCPKeepAlive'.
#
#   The client alive messages are sent through the
#   encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable.
#
#   The TCP keepalive option enabled by 'TCPKeepAlive'
#   is spoofable.
#
#   The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client
#   or server depend on knowing when a connection has
#   become inactive.
#
#   Example: If 'ClientAliveInterval' is set to '15',
#   and 'ClientAliveCountMax' is left at the
#   default, unresponsive SSH clients will be
#   disconnected after approximately '45' seconds.
#
#   'ClientAliveCountMax' defaults to '3'.
