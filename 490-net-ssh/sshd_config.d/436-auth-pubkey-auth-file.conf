#
#   'AuthorizedKeysFile' specifies the file that contains
#   the public keys used for user authentication.

#   The format is described in the AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE
#   FORMAT section of sshd(8).  Arguments to

#   After TOKEN expansion, 'AuthorizedKeysFile' is
#   taken to be an absolute path or one relative to
#   the user's home directory.
#
#   Multiple files may be listed, separated by
#   whitespace.  Alternately this option may be set to
#   none to skip checking for user keys in files.
