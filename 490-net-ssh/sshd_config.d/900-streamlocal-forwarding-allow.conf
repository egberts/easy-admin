# Title: Allow the Forwarding of Local Streams
# Description:
#
#   'AllowStreamLocalForwarding' specifies whether
#   'StreamLocal' (Unix-domain socket) forwarding is
#   permitted.
#
#   The available options are 'yes' (default) or
#   all to allow 'StreamLocal' forwarding, 'no' to
#   prevent all 'StreamLocal' forwarding, 'local' to
#   allow local (from the perspective of ssh(1))
#   forwarding only or 'remote' to allow remote forwarding
#   only.
#
#   NOTE: Disabling 'StreamLocal' forwarding does not
#       improve security unless users are also denied
#       shell access, as they can always install
#       their own forwarders.
#
#   'AllowStreamLocalForwarding' defaults to 'yes'.
#
#   'AllowStreamLocalForwarding' option may be used
#   after the 'Match' statement and within its
#   'Match' block portion of sshd_config(5)
#   configuration file.
#
#   NOTE: Seems to be used only by SFTP subsystem.
