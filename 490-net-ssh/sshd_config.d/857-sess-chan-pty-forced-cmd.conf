# Title: Forced Command
# Description:
#
#   'ForceCommand' forces the execution of the command
#   specified by 'ForceCommand', ignoring any command
#   supplied by the client and ~/.ssh/rc if present.
#
#   The command is invoked by using the user's login
#   shell with the -c option.  This applies to shell,
#   command, or subsystem execution.  It is most useful
#   inside a Match block.  The command originally
#   supplied by the client is available in the
#   SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND environment variable.
#
#   Specifying a command of internal-sftp will force the
#   use of an in-process SFTP server that requires no
#   support files when used with ChrootDirectory.
#
#   'ForceCommand' defaults to 'none'.
#
# CLI option: -oForceCommand=none
# CLI option: -oForceCommand=<string>

# WARNING: SSH Bastion mode requires the option
#          'ForceCommand' to be something OTHER than 'none'
#          and pointing to an executable that does nothing
#          but 'audit'.
#
#          Suggestions like '/usr/bin/nologin' would not
#          audit well under 'PermitTTY no'.
#
#          Try using '/usr/bin/false' for a total 39K byte
#          pointing to nearly-zero dynamic library.
