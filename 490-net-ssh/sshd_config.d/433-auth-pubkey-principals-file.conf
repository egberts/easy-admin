# Title: Does User Have an Authorized Certificate to Login
# Description:
#
#   AuthorizedPrincipalsFile specifies a file that 
#   lists principal names that are accepted for 
#   certificate authentication.  
#   
#   When using certificates signed by a key listed in 
#   TrustedUserCAKeys, this file lists names, one of 
#   which must appear in the certificate for it to be 
#   accepted for authentication.  
#   
#   Names are listed one per line preceded by key 
#   options (as described in AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE 
#   FORMAT in sshd(8)).  
#   
#   Empty lines and comments starting with ‘#’ are ignored.
#
#   Arguments to AuthorizedPrincipalsFile accept the 
#   tokens described in the TOKENS section.  
#
#   After expansion, AuthorizedPrincipalsFile is 
#   taken to be an absolute path or one relative to 
#   the user's home directory.  
#
#   AuthorizedPrincipalsFile defaults to none, i.e. 
#   not to use a principals file – in this case, the 
#   username of the user must appear in a 
#   certificate's principals list for it to be 
#   accepted.
#
#   Note that AuthorizedPrincipalsFile is only used 
#   when authentication proceeds using a CA listed in 
#   TrustedUserCAKeys and is not consulted for 
#   certification authorities trusted 
#   via ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, though the 
#   principals= key option offers a similar 
#   facility (see sshd(8) for details).
#
#   AuthorizedPrincipalsFile accepts the tokens:
#
#      %%, %h, %U, and %u
#
# CLI option: -oAuthorizedPrincipalsFile=
# CLI option: -oAuthorizedPrincipalsFile=none
