# Title:
# Description:
#
#   TcpKeepAlive specifies whether the system should 
#   send TCP keepalive messages over SSH control 
#   channel to the other side.  
#
#   If they are sent, death of the connection or crash 
#   of one of the machines will be properly noticed.  
#
#   However, this means that connections will die if 
#   the route is down temporarily, and some people 
#   find it annoying.
#
#   On the other hand, if TCP keepalives are not sent,
#   sessions may hang indefinitely on the server,
#   leaving "ghost" users and consuming server resources.
#
#   This option was formerly called 'KeepAlive'.
#
#   To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should
#   be set to no.
#
#   TcpKeepAlive defaults to yes (to send TCP 
#   keepalive messages), and the server will notice 
#   if the network goes down or the client host 
#   crashes.  This avoids infinitely hanging sessions.
#
# CLI option: -oTcpKeepAlive=<boolean>
