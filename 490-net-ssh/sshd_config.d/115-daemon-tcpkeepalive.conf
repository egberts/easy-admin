# Title: TCP keepalive probe control
# Description:
#
#   'TcpKeepAlive' specifies whether the system should
#   send TCP keepalive messages over SSH control
#   channel to the other side.
#
#   If they are sent, death of the connection or crash
#   of one of the machines will be properly noticed.
#
#   However, this means that connections will die if
#   the route is down temporarily, and some people
#   find it annoying.
#
#   On the other hand, if TCP keepalives are not sent,
#   sessions may hang indefinitely on the server,
#   leaving "ghost" users and consuming server resources.
#
#   This option was formerly called 'KeepAlive'.
#
#   To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should
#   be set to 'no'.
#
#   'TcpKeepAlive' defaults to 'yes' (to send TCP
#   keepalive messages), and the server will notice
#   if the network goes down or the client host
#   crashes.  This avoids infinitely hanging sessions.
#
#   Warnings:
#     - Enabled keepalives can prematurely drop idle sessions.
