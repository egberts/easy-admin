# Title: Source connection penalty controls
# Description:
#   Controls temporary penalties applied to client source addresses
#   for various conditions that may be considered abusive. 
#
#   If enabled, clients may be refused connection for
#   configured durations after certain events (auth fail,
#   crash, refuse by RefuseConnection, etc.).
#
#   Valid values:
#       no
#       crash:duration
#       authfail:duration
#       refuseconnection:duration
#       noauth:duration
#
#   PerSourcePenalties helps protect the SSH server from
#   abusive clients by tracking source addresses and
#   refusing connections when certain bad conditions occur.
#
#   Penalized IP addresses (and possibly their CIDR block)
#   will be temporarily refused connections.
#
#   This functionality offers a built‑in mechanism similar
#   in spirit to tools like Fail2Ban, but implemented
#   directly in sshd itself.
