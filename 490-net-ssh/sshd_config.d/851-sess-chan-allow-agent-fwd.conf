# Title: Determine the Allow Forwarding during Key Exchange
# Description:
#
#   'AllowAgentForwarding' specifies whether ssh-agent(1)
#   forwarding is permitted.
#
#   'AllowAgentForwarding' option defaults to 'yes'.
#
#   NOTE: disabling agent forwarding does not improve
#       security unless users are also denied shell access,
#       as they can always install their own forwarders.
#
#   'AllowAgentForwarding' option may be used after
#   the 'Match' statement and within its
#   'Match' block portion of sshd_config(5)
#   configuration file.
#
# CLI option: -oAllowAgentForwarding=<boolean>
# Introduced: 5.1
# Obsoleted:
# Process context: server daemon
# Dispatch: SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST
# Channel type: auth-agent-req@openssh.com
# State: SSH_CHANNEL_LARVAL
# State: SSH_CHANNEL_OPEN
# Protocol leg: key exchange (KEX)
