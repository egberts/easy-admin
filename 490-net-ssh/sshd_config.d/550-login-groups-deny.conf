# Title: Deny a list of groups of users
# Description:
#
#   'DenyGroups' keyword can be followed by a list of
#   group name patterns, separated by spaces.
#
#   Login is disallowed for users whose primary
#   group or supplementary group list matches one
#   of the patterns.
#
#   Only group names are valid; a numerical
#   group ID is not recognized.  By default, login is
#   allowed for all groups.
#
#   The allow/deny directives are processed in the
#   following order:
#
#       DenyUsers,
#       AllowUsers,
#       DenyGroups, and
#       AllowGroups.
#
# DenyGroups default is not to use its keyword.
