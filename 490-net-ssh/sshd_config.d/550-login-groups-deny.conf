# DenyGroups keyword can be followed by a list of
# group name patterns, separated by spaces.  Login
# is disallowed for users whose primary group or
# supplementary group list matches one of the
# patterns.  Only group names are valid; a numerical
# group ID is not recognized.  By default, login is
# allowed for all groups.  The allow/deny directives
# are processed in the following order: DenyUsers,
# AllowUsers, DenyGroups, and finally AllowGroups.
#
# CLI option: -o
# options.deny_groups[]/allowed_user()
# DenyGroups default is not to use its keyword.
