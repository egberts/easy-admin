# Title: X11 Support
# Description:
#
#   'X11Forwarding' specifies whether X11 forwarding is
#   permitted.
#
#   The argument must be 'yes' or 'no'.
#
#   'X11Forwarding' defaults to 'no'.
#
#   When X11 forwarding is enabled, there may be
#   additional exposure to the server and to client
#   displays if the sshd(8) proxy display is configured
#   to listen on the wildcard address (see
#   'X11UseLocalhost'), though this is not the default.
#   Additionally, the authentication spoofing and
#   authentication data verification and substitution
#   occur on the client side.  The security risk of
#   using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11
#   display server may be exposed to attack when the SSH
#   client requests forwarding (see the warnings for
#   ForwardX11 in ssh_config(5)).  A system
#   administrator may have a stance in which they want
#   to protect clients that may expose themselves to
#   attack by unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding,
#   which can warrant a no setting.
#
#   Note that disabling X11 forwarding does not prevent
#   users from forwarding X11 traffic, as users can
#   always install their own forwarders.
#
#   NOTE: Debian openssh-server package sets 'X11Forwarding'
#       option to 'yes' as standard in # /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#       which are not the default in sshd(8).
