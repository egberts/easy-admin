# Title: Allow TCP Forwarding
# Description:
#
#   'AllowTcpForwarding' specifies whether TCP forwarding
#   is permitted.
#
#   The available options are 'yes' (default) or
#   'all' to allow TCP forwarding, 'no' to prevent all
#   TCP forwarding, 'local' to allow local (from the
#   perspective of ssh(1)) forwarding only or 'remote'
#   to allow remote forwarding only.
#
#   NOTE: disabling TCP forwarding does not improve
#       security unless users are also denied shell
#       access, as they can always install their
#       own forwarders.
#
#   WARNING: If you say no to `AllowTcpForwarding`,
#          SaSSHimi can easily evade this by reverse
#          tunneling back into your original SSH
#          session.
#
#   BEST PRACTICE: Always say 'no' and if you really
#      want to BLOCK tcp-forwarding in both SSH-Control
#      "forwarded-tcpip" and "direct-tcpip" channels, you
#      must not provide a SHELL for that username.
#
#   INFO: You cannot selective admin these two SSH control
#       channels apart.
#
#   WARNING: Bastion SSH Jump server must not supply any SHELL.
#
#   CAVEAT: This is a weak security feature.
#
#   'AllowTcpForwarding' defaults to 'yes'.
