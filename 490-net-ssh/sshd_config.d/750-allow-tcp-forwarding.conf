# Title: Allow TCP Forwarding
# Description:
#
#   AllowTcpForwarding specifies whether TCP forwarding
#   is permitted.  
#
#   The available options are yes (the default) or 
#   all to allow TCP forwarding, no to prevent all 
#   TCP forwarding, local to allow local (from the 
#   perspective of ssh(1)) forwarding only or remote 
#   to allow remote forwarding only.
#
# NOTE: disabling TCP forwarding does not improve
#       security unless users are also denied shell 
#       access, as they can always install their 
#       own forwarders.
# 
# WARNING: If you say no to `AllowTcpForwarding`,
#          SaSSHimi can easily evade this by reverse 
#          tunneling back into your original SSH 
#          session.
#
# BEST PRACTICE: Always say 'no' and if you really
#      want to BLOCK tcp-forwarding in both SSH-Control 
#      "forwarded-tcpip" and "direct-tcpip" channels, you 
#      must not provide a SHELL for that username.
#
# INFO: You cannot selective admin these two SSH control 
#       channels apart.
#
# WARNING: Bastion SSH Jump server must not supply any SHELL.
#
# CAVEAT: This is a weak security feature.
#
#   AllowTcpForwarding defaults to 'yes'.
