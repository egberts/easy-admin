# DenyUsers keyword can be followed by a list of user
# name patterns, separated by spaces.  Login is
# disallowed for user names that match one of the
# patterns.  Only user names are valid; a numerical
# user ID is not recognized.  By default, login is
# allowed for all users.  If the pattern takes the
# form USER@HOST then USER and HOST are separately
# checked, restricting logins to particular users from
# particular hosts.  HOST criteria may additionally
# contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen
# format.  The allow/deny directives are processed in
# the following order: DenyUsers, AllowUsers,
# DenyGroups, and finally AllowGroups.
#
# DenyUsers default is not to use its keyword.
#
# CLI option: -o DenyUsers=
# Default: no default (omitted option: any users).
# options.deny_users[]/allowed_user()
