# Title: OpenSSH Required RSA Size
# Description:
#
#   Specifies the minimum RSA key size (in bits) that 
#   sshd(8) will accept. User and host-based authentication 
#   keys smaller than this limit will be refused. 
#
#   The default is 1024 bits.  
#
#   Default is compile-defined by 
#   SSH_RSA_MINIMUM_MODULUS_SIZE define macro.
#
#   Note that this limit may only be raised from the default.
#
#  Ideally, you would not use any form of RSA algorithms
#  but this setting here is an assurance that if 
#  accidential RSA algorithm gets used, then its minimum
#  key size shall be 3072 or greater.
#
#  Only integer value are permitted
#
#  Available at OpenSSH v9.1+
