# Title: Which username To Run As When Checking Authorized Pubkeys
# Description:
#
#   'AuthorizedKeysCommandUser' specifies the user under
#   whose account the 'AuthorizedKeysCommand' is run.
#
#   It is recommended to use a dedicated user that has
#   no other role on the host than running authorized
#   keys commands.
#
#   If 'AuthorizedKeysCommand' is specified but
#   'AuthorizedKeysCommandUser' is not, then
#   sshd(8) will refuse to start.
#
#   'AuthorizedKeysCommandUser' default is not to
#   use its keyword.
