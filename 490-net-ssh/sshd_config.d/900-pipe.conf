# SSH Session Method #4 - Streamlocal via pipe

# AllowStreamLocalForwarding specifies whether
# StreamLocal (Unix-domain socket) forwarding is
# permitted.  The available options are yes (the
# default) or all to allow StreamLocal forwarding, no
# to prevent all StreamLocal forwarding, local to
# allow local (from the perspective of ssh(1))
# forwarding only or remote to allow remote forwarding
# only.
#
# NOTE: Disabling StreamLocal forwarding does not
# improve security unless users are also denied shell
# access, as they can always install their own
# forwarders.
#
# AllowStreamLocalForwarding defaults to 'yes'.
#
# CLI option: -o AllowStreamLocalForwarding=
# Default: 'yes'
AllowStreamLocalForwarding yes

# StreamLocalBindMask sets the octal file creation mode
# mask (umask) used when creating a Unix-domain socket
# file for local or remote port forwarding.  This
# option is only used for port forwarding to a
# Unix-domain socket file.
#
# The default value is 0177, which creates a
# Unix-domain socket file that is readable and writable
# only by the owner.  Note that not all operating
# systems honor the file mode on Unix-domain
# socket files.
#
# StreamLocalBindMask defaults to '0177'.
#
# CLI option: -o StreamLocalBindMask=
# Default: 0177
