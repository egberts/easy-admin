# Title: Use Name From Packet for Reverse DNS Lookup
# Description:
#
#   'HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly' specifies whether
#   or not the server will attempt to perform a reverse
#   name lookup when matching the name in the ~/.shosts,
#   ~/.rhosts, and /etc/hosts.equiv files during
#   'HostbasedAuthentication'.  A setting of 'yes' means
#   that sshd(8) uses the name supplied by the client
#   rather than attempting to resolve the name from the
#   TCP connection itself.
#
#   'HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly' defaults to 'no'.
#
