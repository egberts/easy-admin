# Title: Immediate connection refusal policy
# Description:
#
#   'RefuseConnection' controls whether sshd immediately closes
#   incoming TCP connections without performing protocol
#   negotiation.
#
#   Syntax:
#
#     RefuseConnection yes|no
#
#   When enabled, sshd accepts the TCP connection and then
#   immediately terminates it.

#     - Appears to remote clients as a protocol failure.
