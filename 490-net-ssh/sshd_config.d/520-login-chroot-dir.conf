# ChrootDirectory specifies the pathname of a
# directory to chroot(2) to after authentication.
# At session startup sshd(8) checks that all
# components of the pathname are root-owned
# directories which are not writable by any other user
# or group.  After the chroot, sshd(8) changes the
# working directory to the user's home directory.
# Arguments to ChrootDirectory accept the tokens
# described in the TOKENS section.
#
# The ChrootDirectory must contain the necessary files
# and directories to support the user's session.  For
# an interactive session this requires at least a shell,
# typically sh(1), and basic /dev nodes such as
# null(4), zero(4), stdin(4), stdout(4), stderr(4),
# and tty(4) devices.  For file transfer sessions
# using SFTP no additional configuration of the
# environment is necessary if the inprocess
# sftp-server is used, though sessions which use
# logging may require /dev/log inside the chroot
# directory on some operating systems (see
# sftp-server(8) for details).
#
# For safety, it is very important that the directory
# hierarchy be prevented from modification by other
# processes on the system (especially those outside the
# jail).  Misconfiguration can lead to unsafe
# environments which sshd(8) cannot detect.
#
# ChrootDirectory accepts the tokens %%, %h, %U, and %u.
# ChrootDirectory none   # that doesn't work @ 7.9p1, so commenting out ChrootDirectory: error: Missing privilege separation directory: /var/empty
