# Title: Maximum Login Tries per Session
# Description:
#
#   'MaxAuthTries' specifies the maximum number of
#   authentication attempts permitted per connection.
#
#   Once the number of failures reaches half this value,
#   additional failures are logged.
#
#   'MaxAuthTries' defaults to '6'.
#
# Note: This setting's minimum value is largely governed by
#       the 'AuthenticationMethods' and the counts
#       of each methods mentioned therewithin
#       of the same login session (TCP-connection).
#
#       AM=password counts as 1 minimum.
#       AM=publickey,password counts as 2 minimum.
#       'AM=publickey,password password' counts as 3 minimum.
#       'AM=publickey publickey,password password' counts as 4 minimum.
#
#       Anything less than the minimum and its 'AuthenticationMethods' would
#       not be fully provided but partially offered.
