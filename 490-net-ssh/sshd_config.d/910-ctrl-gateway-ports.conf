# Title: Allow remote hosts to connect to forwarded ports
# Description:
#
#   'GatewayPorts' specifies whether remote hosts are
#   allowed to connect to ports forwarded for the
#   client.  
#
#   By default, sshd(8) binds remote port
#   forwardings to the loopback address.  This prevents
#   other remote hosts from connecting to forwarded
#   ports.  
#
#   'GatewayPorts' can be used to specify that sshd
#   should allow remote port forwardings to bind to
#   non-loopback addresses, thus allowing other hosts to
#   connect.  
#
#   The argument may be 'no' to force remote port
#   forwardings to be available to the local host only,
#   'yes' to force remote port forwardings to bind to the
#   wildcard address, or clientspecified to allow the
#   client to select the address to which the forwarding
#   is bound.
#
#   'GatewayPorts' defaults to 'no'.
