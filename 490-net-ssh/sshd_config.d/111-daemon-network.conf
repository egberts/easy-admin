# Title: OpenSSH daemon network-related settings
# Description:
#
#   Port specifies the port number that sshd(8) 
#   listens on.
#
#   Multiple options of this type are permitted.
#
#   Port keyword must be before ListenAddress.
#
#   Port defaults to 22.
#
# SECURITY: If using a non-port-22, try and use a port
#     number less than 1024; in the case of a sshd crash,
#     malicious end-user (not yet root) could take over
#     YOUR "non-privileged" port number and then easily
#     setup a script-based SSHD daemon using THAT port
#     number as a non-root ... of which you would be
#     allowing your custom-made pinhole of this
#     non-privileged port number at firewall-level for
#     allowing later logins for a potentially evil purpose.
#
