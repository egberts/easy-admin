# Title: To Enable Host-based Authentication option
# Description:
#
#   'HostbasedAuthentication' specifies whether rhosts or
#   /etc/hosts.equiv authentication together with
#   successful public key client host authentication is
#   allowed (host-based authentication).
#
#   'HostbasedAuthentication' defaults to 'no'.
#
#   If 'yes', following options becomes available:
#
#   - 'IgnoreRhosts'
#   - 'IgnoreUserKnownHosts'
#
#   'HostbasedAuthentication' option may also be used
#   within 'Match' block.
#
#   make hostbased authentication send the signature algorithm
#   in its SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST packets instead of the key type.
#   This make 'HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms' do what it is supposed to -
#   filter on signature algorithm and not key type. (v8.4)
