# Title: Select Hash Algorithm for Fingerprinting
# Description:
#
#   'FingerprintHash' specifies the hash algorithm used
#   when logging key fingerprints.
#
#   Also used to compare against queried SSHFP resource
#   record data provided by its DNS server as referenced by
#   its hostname
#
#   Valid options are: md5 and sha256 (case-insensitive).
#
#   However, the prompting of:
#       "Are you sure you want to continue connecting "
#       "(yes/no/[fingerprint])?"
#     must be in lowercase (v8.4).
#
#   FingerprintHash defaults to 'sha256'.
#
# CLI option: -o FingerprintHash=md5
# CLI option: -o FingerprintHash=sha256
