# Title: PAM Service Name
# Description:
#
#   During keyboard authentication method upon incoming
#   SSH connection, the SSH daemon will extract the name
#   of the PAM service (default 'sshd') from the 
#   'PAMServiceName' configuration in sshd then use
#   the PAM service name to consult the PAM files 
#   (typically in /etc/pam.d) for access privilege.
#
#   Historical: Currently, openssh's PAM service name is a 
#   compile-time choice.  That's fine when one uses one sshd 
#   to serve normal shell logins and the like. But this will 
#   not work IF sshd is nor run as root (which I don't want 
#   it to do), because pam_open_session usually requires 
#   access to one's shadow information (for account 
#   expiration perhaps?), and there is no way (and need: this 
#   sshd is installed to handle a specific task (or a set of 
#   tasks, really), where NO pam work is needed at all - to 
#   only allow port forwarding for several authorized (via 
#   keys) parties, something like tunnels - just to give an 
#   example) to give this information to a non-root process. 
#
#   Requires 'KbdAuthentication' option at 'yes'.
#
#   Requires 'UsePAM' option at 'yes'.
#
#   PAMServiceName defaults to "sshd".
#
#   Introduced in OpenSSH v9.8+.
