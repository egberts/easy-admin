# Title: PAM Service Name
# Description:
#
#   'PAMServiceName', if not defined, will extract the name
#   of the PAM service (default 'sshd') during keyboard
#   authentication method upon incoming SSH connection then
#   use the PAM service name to consult the PAM files
#   (typically in /etc/pam.d) for access privilege.
#
#   Historical: Currently, openssh's PAM service name is a
#   compile-time choice.  That's fine when one uses one sshd
#   to serve normal shell logins and the like. But this will
#   not work IF sshd is nor run as root (which is normally
#   not secured), because pam_open_session usually requires
#   access to one's shadow information (for account
#   expiration perhaps?), and there is no way (and need: this
#   sshd is installed to handle a specific task (or a set of
#   tasks, really), where NO pam work is needed at all - to
#   only allow port forwarding for several authorized (via
#   keys) parties, something like tunnels - just to give an
#   example) to give this information to a non-root process.
#
#   Requires 'KbdAuthentication' option at 'yes'.
#
#   Requires 'UsePAM' option at 'yes'.
#
#   PAMServiceName defaults to "sshd".
#
#   It remains relevant only when UsePAM yes is enabled.
#
#   It has no effect if PAM support is compiled out
#   (--without-pam during OpenSSH build).
