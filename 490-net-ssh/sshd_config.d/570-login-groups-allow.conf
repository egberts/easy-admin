# AllowGroups keyword can be followed by a list of
# group name patterns, separated by spaces.  If
# specified, login is allowed only for users whose
# primary group or supplementary group list
# matches one of the patterns.  Only group names are
# valid; a numerical group ID is not recognized.
# By default, login is allowed for all groups.
#
# The allow/deny directives are processed in the
# following order: DenyUsers, AllowUsers, DenyGroups,
# and finally AllowGroups.
#
# AllowGroups default is not to use its keyword.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
#
# It is ideal to use 'ssh-user' here.
#
# FUTURE: As soon as 'ssh' daemon starts to use non-root-GID at systemd startup:
#   use 'ssh-in' GID for login-specific (ie., no access to /etc/ssh/sshd_config)
#
#   use 'ssh-out' GID for client-specific (ie., /etc/ssh/ssh_config*)
#
#   use 'sshd' for daemon-specific (ie., /etc/ssh/sshd_config*)
