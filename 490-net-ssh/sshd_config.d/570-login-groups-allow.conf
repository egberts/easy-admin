# Title: Allow Groups of Users during Login
# Description:
#
#   'AllowGroups' keyword can be followed by a list of
#   group name patterns, separated by spaces.  If
#   specified, login is allowed only for users whose
#   primary group or supplementary group list
#   matches one of the patterns.
#
#   Only group names are valid; a numerical group
#   ID is not recognized.
#
#   By default, login is allowed for all groups.
#
#   The allow/deny directives are processed in the
#   following order:
#
#     1. DenyUsers,
#     2. AllowUsers,
#     3. DenyGroups, and finally
#     4. AllowGroups.
#
#   AllowGroups default is not to use its keyword.
#
#   It is ideal to use 'ssh-user' here.
#
# FUTURE: As soon as 'ssh' daemon starts to use
#         non-root-GID at systemd startup:
#
#         use 'ssh-in' GID for login-specific (ie., no
#         access to /etc/ssh/sshd_config)
#
#         use 'ssh-out' GID for client-specific
#         (ie., /etc/ssh/ssh_config*)
#
#         use 'sshd' for daemon-specific
#         (ie., /etc/ssh/sshd_config*)
#
#   'AllowGroups' option may be used after
#   the 'Match' statement and within its
#   'Match' block portion of sshd_config(5)
#   configuration file.
