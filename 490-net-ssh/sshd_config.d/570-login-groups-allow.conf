# Title: Allow Groups of Users during Login
# Description:
#
#   AllowGroups keyword can be followed by a list of
#   group name patterns, separated by spaces.  If
#   specified, login is allowed only for users whose
#   primary group or supplementary group list
#   matches one of the patterns.  
#
#   Only group names are valid; a numerical group 
#   ID is not recognized.
#
#   By default, login is allowed for all groups.
#
#   The allow/deny directives are processed in the
#   following order: 
#
#     1. DenyUsers, 
#     2. AllowUsers, 
#     3. DenyGroups, and finally 
#     4. AllowGroups.
#
#   AllowGroups default is not to use its keyword.
#
#   It is ideal to use 'ssh-user' here.
#
# FUTURE: As soon as 'ssh' daemon starts to use 
#         non-root-GID at systemd startup:
#
#         use 'ssh-in' GID for login-specific (ie., no 
#         access to /etc/ssh/sshd_config)
#
#         use 'ssh-out' GID for client-specific 
#         (ie., /etc/ssh/ssh_config*)
#
#         use 'sshd' for daemon-specific 
#         (ie., /etc/ssh/sshd_config*)
#
#   'AllowGroups' option may be used after
#   the 'Match' statement and within its
#   'Match' block portion of sshd_config(5)
#   configuration file.
#
# CLI option: -o AllowGroups=
# Default: no default (omitted means not used)
# Variable: options.allow_groups[]
# Source (read): allowed_user()
