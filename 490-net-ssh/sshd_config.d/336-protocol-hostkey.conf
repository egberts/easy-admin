# HostKey specifies a file containing a private host
# key used by SSH.
# NOTE: sshd(8) will refuse to use a file if it is
# group/world-accessible and that the
# HostKeyAlgorithms option restricts which of the keys
# are actually used by sshd(8).
#
# It is possible to have multiple host key files.  It
# is also possible to specify public host key files
# instead.  In this case operations on the private key
# will be delegated to an ssh-agent(1).
