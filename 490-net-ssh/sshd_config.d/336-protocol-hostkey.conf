# Title: Use This Local Host Key File during Authentication
# Description:
#
#   'HostKey' specifies a file containing a private host
#   key used by SSH.
#
#   NOTE: sshd(8) will refuse to use a file if it is
#   group/world-accessible and that the
#   'HostKeyAlgorithms' option restricts which of the keys
#   are actually used by sshd(8).
#
#   It is possible to have multiple host key files.
#
#   It is also possible to specify public host key
#   files instead.  In this case operations on the
#   private key will be delegated to an ssh-agent(1).
#
#   HostKey defaults to
#       /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key,
#       /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key and
#       /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.
