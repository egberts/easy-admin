# Title: Match By IP Address
# Description:
#
#   'Match' introduces a conditional block.  If all of the
#   criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the
#   keywords on the following lines override those set
#   in the global section of the config file, until
#   either another Match line or the end of the file.
#   If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that
#   are satisfied, only the first instance of the
#   keyword is applied.
#
#   The arguments to Match are one or more
#   criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which
#   matches all criteria.  The available criteria are
#   User, Group, Host, LocalAddress, LocalPort, RDomain,
#   and Address (with RDomain representing the
#   rdomain(4) on which the connection was received.)
#
#   The match patterns may consist of single entries or
#   comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and
#   negation operators described in the PATTERNS section
#   of ssh_config(5).
#
#   The patterns in an Address criteria may additionally
#   contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen
#   format, such as 192.0.2.0/24 or 2001:db8::/32.
#   NOTE: the mask length provided must be consistent
#       with the address - it is an error to specify a
#       mask length that is too long for the address
#       or one with bits set in this host portion of
#       the address.  For example, 192.0.2.0/33 and
#       192.0.2.0/8, respectively.
#
#   Keyword 'include' statement works well within match files (v8.4).
#
#   Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines
#   following a Match keyword.
#   Available keywords are:
#       AcceptEnv, AllowAgentForwarding, AllowGroups,
#       AllowStreamLocalForwarding, AllowTcpForwarding,
#       AllowUsers, AuthenticationMethods,
#       AuthorizedKeysCommand, AuthorizedKeysCommandUser,
#       AuthorizedKeysFile, AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand,
#       AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser,
#       AuthorizedPrincipalsFile, Banner,
#       ChrootDirectory, ClientAliveCountMax,
#       ClientAliveInterval, DenyGroups, DenyUsers,
#       ForceCommand, GatewayPorts, GSSAPIAuthentication,
#       HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes,
#       HostbasedAuthentication,
#       HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly, IPQoS,
#       KbdInteractiveAuthentication,
#       KerberosAuthentication, LogLevel, MaxAuthTries,
#       MaxSessions, PasswordAuthentication,
#       PermitEmptyPasswords, PermitListen, PermitOpen,
#       PermitRootLogin, PermitTTY, PermitTunnel,
#       PermitUserRC, PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes,
#       PubkeyAuthentication, RekeyLimit, RevokedKeys,
#       RDomain, SetEnv, StreamLocalBindMask,
#       StreamLocalBindUnlink, TrustedUserCAKeys,
#       X11DisplayOffset, X11Forwarding and
#       X11UseLocalHost.
