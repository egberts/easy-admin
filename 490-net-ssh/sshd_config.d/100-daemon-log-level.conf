# Title: Server-side logging behavior
# Description:
#
#   'LogLevel' keyword defines the logging verbosity used by
#   the OpenSSH server daemon (sshd). 
#
#   It affects which events are emitted to syslog (or
#   systemd-journald, depending on system configuration)
#   during daemon startup, connection handling,
#   authentication, and session lifecycle.
#
# Syntax:  LogLevel <level>
#
# The LogLevel directive controls the minimum severity of messages
# that sshd will log.
#
# Valid level values (ascending verbosity)
# ----------------------------------
#   QUIET
#     Suppresses all non-critical log messages.
#
#   FATAL
#     Logs only fatal errors that cause sshd to exit.
#
#   ERROR
#     Logs error conditions that prevent correct operation.
#
#   INFO
#     Logs informational messages about connections, authentication,
#     and normal operation. This is the default if LogLevel is unset.
#
#   VERBOSE
#     Logs INFO-level messages plus additional details about
#     authentication attempts, key usage, and connection parameters.
#
#   DEBUG
#   DEBUG1
#     Equivalent values. Enables debugging output intended primarily
#     for troubleshooting and development.
#
#   DEBUG2
#     Enables more detailed debugging output, including internal
#     state transitions.
#
#   DEBUG3
#     Enables the highest verbosity, including packet-level and
#     protocol debugging.
#
# Privacy and Security Considerations
# -----------------------------------
# Logging at DEBUG, DEBUG2, or DEBUG3 levels may expose sensitive
# information, including usernames, authentication methods, key
# fingerprints, and protocol details. These levels are unsuitable
# for production systems.
#
# Operational Guidance
# --------------------
# - INFO is suitable for most production environments.
# - VERBOSE is commonly used on servers requiring enhanced audit
#   visibility without full debug output.
# - DEBUG* levels should be used temporarily and only during
#   active troubleshooting.
#
#
# CLI option: -d = run in debug mode (equivalent to DEBUG1)
