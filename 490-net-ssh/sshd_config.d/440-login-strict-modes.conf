# Title: Check file ownership/permission of User's HOME directory
# Description:
#
#   'StrictModes' specifies whether sshd(8) should check
#   file modes and ownership of the user's files and
#   home directory before accepting login.  
#
#   This is normally desirable because novices sometimes
#   accidentally leave their directory or files
#   world-writable.
#
#   NOTE: this does not apply to ChrootDirectory,
#       whose permissions and ownership are checked
#       unconditionally.
#
#   'StrictModes' defaults to 'yes'.
#
# AuthenticateMethods: hostbased,publickey
# CLI option: -o StrictModes=
