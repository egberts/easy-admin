# StrictModes specifies whether sshd(8) should check
# file modes and ownership of the user's files and
# home directory before accepting login.  This is
# normally desirable because novices sometimes
# accidentally leave their directory or files
# world-writable.
#
# NOTE: this does not apply to ChrootDirectory,
# whose permissions and ownership are checked
# unconditionally.
#
# StrictModes default is yes.
#
# 'AuthenticateMethods': hostbased
# Channel type: auth (pre-channel)
# CLI option: -o StrictModes=
# Process context: main()/server
# options.strict_modes/auth_rhosts2()/hostbased_key_allowed()
# options.strict_modes/user_key_allowed2()
StrictModes yes
