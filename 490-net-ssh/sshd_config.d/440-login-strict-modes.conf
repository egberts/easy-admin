# Title: Check file ownership/permission of User's HOME directory
# Description:
#
#   StrictModes specifies whether sshd(8) should check
#   file modes and ownership of the user's files and
#   home directory before accepting login.  This is
#   normally desirable because novices sometimes
#   accidentally leave their directory or files
#   world-writable.
#
# NOTE: this does not apply to ChrootDirectory,
#       whose permissions and ownership are checked
#       unconditionally.
#
#   StrictModes defaults to yes.
#
# 'AuthenticateMethods': hostbased
# Channel type: auth (pre-channel)
# CLI option: -o StrictModes=
# Process context: main()/server
# Variable: options.strict_modes
# Source (read): auth_rhosts2()/hostbased_key_allowed()
# Source (read): user_key_allowed2()
#
StrictModes yes
