# File: 112-daemon-pidfile.conf
# Path: /etc/ssh/ (sshd_config) or /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
# Title: Daemon PID file location
# Description:
#
#   'PidFile' specifies the filesystem path where sshd writes
#   its process identifier after startup.
#
#   Syntax:
#
#     PidFile <absolute-path>
#
#   'PidFile' specifies the file that contains the process
#   ID of the SSH daemon, or 'none' to not write one.
#
#   Its file contains the process ID of the sshd listening
#   for connections (if there are several daemons running
#   concurrently for different ports, this contains
#   the process ID of the one started last).
#
#   The BSD OpenSSH default is /var/run/sshd.pid.  The most
#   Linux distros' default to /run/sshd.pid.
#
#   The content of this file is not sensitive;
#   it can be world-readable.
#
#   Warnings:
#     - The directory must be writable by the daemon.
#     - Incorrect paths may interfere with service managers.
