# Title: PID file
# Description:
#
#   'PidFile' specifies the file that contains the process
#   ID of the SSH daemon, or 'none' to not write one.
#
#   Contains the process ID of the sshd listening for
#   connections (if there are several daemons running
#   concurrently for different ports, this contains
#   the process ID of the one started last).
#
#   The content of this file is not sensitive;
#   it can be world-readable.
#
#   The OpenSSH default is /var/run/sshd.pid.
#   The most Linux distros' default is /run/sshd.pid.
