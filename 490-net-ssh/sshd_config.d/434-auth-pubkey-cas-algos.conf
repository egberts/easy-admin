# CASignatureAlgorithms specifies which algorithms are
# allowed for signing of certificates by certificate
# authorities (CAs).
#
# Certificates signed using other algorithms will not
# be accepted for public key or host-based
# authentication.
#
# CASignatureAlgorithms defaults to:
#     ecdsa-sha2-nistp256.ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
#     ssh-ed25519,rsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256,ssh-rsa
#
# 'AuthenticateMethods': hostbased, pubkey
# Channel type: auth (pre-channel)
# CLI option: -o CASignatureAlgorithms=
# options.ca_sign_algorithms/

# working: CASignatureAlgorithms ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,ssh-ed25519,rsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256,ssh-rsa
# most restrictive:
CASignatureAlgorithms ssh-ed25519
