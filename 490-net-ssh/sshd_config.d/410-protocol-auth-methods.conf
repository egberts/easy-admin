# Title: Authentication Methods to Offer to SSH Clients
# Description:
#
#   'AuthenticationMethods' specifies the
#   authentication methods that must be successfully
#   completed for a user to be granted access.
#
#   This option must be followed by one or more lists
#   of comma-separated authentication method names,
#   or by the single string any to indicate the
#   default behaviour of accepting any single
#   authentication method.
#
#   AuthenticatonMethods defaults to 'any'.
#
#   Under Debian, AuthenticationMethods defaults to:
#
#     'gssapi-with-mic,publickey,keyboard-interactive
#      publickey,password password'
#
#   If the default is overridden, then successful
#   authentication requires completion of every
#   method in at least one of these lists.
#
#   The available authentication methods are:
#
#   * "gssapi-with-mic",
#   * "hostbased",
#   * "keyboard-interactive",
#   * "none" (used for access to password-less accounts when
#             'PermitEmptyPassword' is enabled),
#   * "password",
#   * "publickey".
#
#   For example,
#
#       publickey,password publickey,keyboard-interactive
#
#   would require the user to complete public key
#   authentication, followed by either password or
#   keyboard interactive authentication.  Only methods
#   that are next in one or more lists are offered at
#   each stage, so for this example it would not be
#   possible to attempt password or keyboard-interactive
#   authentication before public key.
#
#   For keyboard interactive authentication it is also
#   possible to restrict authentication to a specific
#   device by appending a colon followed by the device
#   identifier bsdauth or pam depending on the server
#   configuration.  For example,
#
#       keyboard-interactive:bsdauth
#
#   would restrict keyboard interactive authentication
#   to the bsdauth device.
#
#   If the publickey method is listed more than once,
#   sshd(8) verifies that keys that have been used
#   successfully are not reused for subsequent
#   authentications.
#
#   For example,
#
#     publickey,publickey
#
#   requires successful authentication using two different
#   public keys.
#
#   - Comma separates auth options that should be tried together.
#   - Space separates auth options that should be tried separately.
#
# Note that each authentication method listed should
# also be explicitly enabled in the configuration.
#
#   Pubkey Authentication
#
#   For example,
#
#       AuthenticationMethods publickey,password publickey,keyboard-interactive
#
#   would require the user to complete public key authentication,
#   followed by either password or keyboard interactive
#   authentication.  Only methods that are next in one or
#   more lists are offered at each stage, so for this example
#   it would not be possible to attempt password or
#   keyboard-interactive authentication before public key.
#
#
##   Keyboard Interactive Authentication
#
#   For keyboard interactive authentication it is also
#   possible to restrict authentication to a specific
#   device by appending a colon followed by the device
#   identifier bsdauth or pam depending on the server
#   configuration.  For example,
#
#       AuthenticationMethods keyboard-interactive:bsdauth
#
#   would restrict keyboard interactive authentication to the bsdauth device.
#
#
## Multiple Pubkey Authentication
#
#   If the publickey method is listed more than once,
#   sshd(8) verifies that keys that have been used
#   successfully are not reused for subsequent
#   authentications.
#
#   For example,
#
#       AuthenticationMethods publickey,publickey
#
#   requires successful authentication using two different public keys.
#
## Note
#
#   A comma that separates auth options are tried together (AND-logic).
#
#   A whitespace that separates auth options are tried separately (OR-logic).
#
#   Note that each authentication method listed should also
#   be explicitly enabled in the configuration.
#
# SECURITY-UPGRADE:
# take off the lone 'password' option in 'AuthenticationMethods'
# after a public key of remote client has been installed on this SSH server
#
# ENHANCEMENT: If TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) has been implemented
# at PAM-level, then add 'publickey,keyboard-interactive' firstly.
