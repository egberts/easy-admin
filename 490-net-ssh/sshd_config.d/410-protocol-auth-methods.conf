# `AuthenticationMethods` specifies the authentication
# methods that must be successfully completed for a
# user to be granted access.  This option must be
# followed by one or more lists of comma-separated
# authentication method names, or by the single string
# any to indicate the default behaviour of accepting
# any single authentication method.  If the default is
# overridden, then successful authentication requires
# completion of every method in at least one of these
# lists.
#
# The available authentication methods are:
#
# * "gssapi-with-mic",
# * "hostbased",
# * "keyboard-interactive",
# * "none" (used for access to password-less accounts when `PermitEmptyPassword` is enabled),
# * "password" and
# * "publickey".
# 
# For example,
#
#    `publickey,password publickey,keyboard-interactive`
#
# would require the user to complete public key
# authentication, followed by either password or
# keyboard interactive authentication.  Only methods
# that are next in one or more lists are offered at
# each stage, so for this example it would not be
# possible to attempt password or keyboard-interactive
# authentication before public key.
#
# For keyboard interactive authentication it is also
# possible to restrict authentication to a specific
# device by appending a colon followed by the device
# identifier bsdauth or pam depending on the server
# configuration.  For example,
#
#     `keyboard-interactive:bsdauth`
#
# would restrict keyboard interactive authentication
# to the bsdauth device.
#
# If the publickey method is listed more than once,
# sshd(8) verifies that keys that have been used
# successfully are not reused for subsequent
# authentications.
#
# For example, 
#
#     `publickey,publickey` 
#
# requires successful authentication using two different
# public keys.
#
# - Comma separates auth options that should be tried together.
# - Space separates auth options that should be tried separately.
#
# Note that each authentication method listed should
# also be explicitly enabled in the configuration.
#
#
## Pubkey Authentication
#
# For example,
# 
#    `AuthenticationMethods publickey,password publickey,keyboard-interactive`
# 
# would require the user to complete public key authentication, 
# followed by either password or keyboard interactive 
# authentication.  Only methods that are next in one or 
# more lists are offered at each stage, so for this example 
# it would not be possible to attempt password or 
# keyboard-interactive authentication before public key.
# 
#
## Keyboard Interactive Authentication
#
# For keyboard interactive authentication it is also
# possible to restrict authentication to a specific
# device by appending a colon followed by the device
# identifier bsdauth or pam depending on the server
# configuration.  For example,
# 
#     `AuthenticationMethods keyboard-interactive:bsdauth`
# 
# would restrict keyboard interactive authentication to the bsdauth device.
# 
#
## Multiple Pubkey Authentication
# 
# If the publickey method is listed more than once, sshd(8) verifies that keys that have been used successfully are not reused for subsequent authentications.
# 
# For example, 
# 
#     AuthenticationMethods publickey,publickey
# 
# requires successful authentication using two different public keys.
# 
## Note
# 
# A comma that separates auth options are tried together (AND-logic).
# 
# A whitespace that separates auth options are tried separately (OR-logic).
# 
# Note that each authentication method listed should also 
# be explicitly enabled in the configuration.
