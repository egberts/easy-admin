# Title: Does User Have an Authorized Certificate to Login
# Description:
#
#   'AuthorizedPrincipalsFile' specifies a file that
#   lists principal names that are accepted for
#   certificate authentication.
#
#   When using certificates signed by a key listed in
#   'TrustedUserCAKeys', this file lists names, one of
#   which must appear in the certificate for it to be
#   accepted for authentication.
#
#   Names are listed one per line preceded by key
#   options (as described in AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE
#   FORMAT in sshd(8)).
#
#   Empty lines and comments starting with ‘#’ are ignored.
#
#   Arguments to 'AuthorizedPrincipalsFile' accept the
#   tokens described in the TOKENS section.
#
#   After expansion, 'AuthorizedPrincipalsFile' is
#   taken to be an absolute path or one relative to
#   the user's home directory.
#
#   'AuthorizedPrincipalsFile' defaults to 'none', i.e.
#   not to use a principals file – in this case, the
#   username of the user must appear in a
#   certificate's principals list for it to be
#   accepted.
#
#   Note that 'AuthorizedPrincipalsFile' is only used
#   when authentication proceeds using a CA listed in
#   TrustedUserCAKeys and is not consulted for
#   certification authorities trusted
#   via ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, though the
#   principals= key option offers a similar
#   facility (see sshd(8) for details).
#
#   'AuthorizedPrincipalsFile' accepts the tokens:
#
#      %%, %h, %U, and %u
#
# CLI option: -oAuthorizedPrincipalsFile=
# CLI option: -oAuthorizedPrincipalsFile=none
