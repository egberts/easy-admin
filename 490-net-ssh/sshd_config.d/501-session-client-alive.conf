# Title: Keep client alive
# Description:
#
#   'ClientAliveInterval' sets a timeout interval in
#   seconds after which if no data has been received
#   from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through
#   the encrypted channel to request a response from the
#   client.
#
#   'ClientAliveInterval' defaults to '0', indicating that
#   these messages will not be sent to the client.
#
# CLI option: -o ClientAliveInterval=
# Introduced: 3.6
# Obsoleted:
# Process context: server daemon
# Channel type: packet
# Source (read): ssh->state->packet_timeout_ms/ssh_packet_set_timeout()/options.client_alive_interval/wait_until_can_do_something()/serverloop.c
#
ClientAliveInterval 300

#   'ClientAliveCountMax' sets the number of client alive
#   messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving
#   any messages back from the client.  If this
#   threshold is reached while client alive messages are
#   being sent, sshd will disconnect the client,
#   terminating the session.  It is important to note
#   that the use of client alive messages is very
#   different from TCPKeepAlive.  The client alive
#   messages are sent through the encrypted channel and
#   therefore will not be spoofable.  The TCP keepalive
#   option enabled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable.  The
#   client alive mechanism is valuable when the client
#   or server depend on knowing when a connection has
#   become inactive.
#
#   Example: If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15,
#   and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the
#   default, unresponsive SSH clients will be
#   disconnected after approximately 45 seconds.
#
#   ClientAliveInterval defaults to '3'.
