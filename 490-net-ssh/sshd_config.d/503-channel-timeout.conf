# Title: Channel Timeout
# Description:
#
#   'ChannelTimeout' specifies whether and how quickly
#   sshd(8) should close inactive channels.
#
#   'ChannelTimeout' are specified as one or more “type=interval”
#   pairs separated by whitespace, where the “type” must
#   be the special keyword “global” or a channel type name
#   from the list below, optionally containing wildcard
#   characters.
#
#   The timeout value "interval" is specified in seconds or may use
#   any of the units documented in the TIME FORMATS section. For
#   example, “session=5m” would cause interactive sessions to
#   terminate after five minutes of inactivity. Specifying a zero
#   value disables the inactivity timeout.
#
#   The special timeout "global" applies to all active channels,
#   taken together. Traffic on any active channel will reset
#   the timeout, but when the timeout expires then all open
#   channels will be closed. Note that this global timeout is
#   not matched by wildcards and must be specified explicitly.
#
#   The available channel type names include:
#
#       agent-connection
#           Open connections to ssh-agent(1).
#       direct-tcpip, direct-streamlocal@openssh.com
#           Open TCP or Unix socket (respectively) connections
#           that have been established from a ssh(1) local
#           forwarding, i.e. LocalForward or DynamicForward.
#       forwarded-tcpip, forwarded-streamlocal@openssh.com
#           Open TCP or Unix socket (respectively) connections
#           that have been established to a sshd(8) listening on
#           behalf of a ssh(1) remote forwarding, i.e.
#           RemoteForward.
#       session
#           The interactive main session, including shell session,
#           command execution, scp(1), sftp(1), etc.
#       tun-connection
#           Open TunnelForward connections.
#       x11-connection
#           Open X11 forwarding sessions.
#
#   Note that in all the above cases, terminating an inactive session
#   does not guarantee to remove all resources associated with the
#   session, e.g. shell processes or X11 clients relating to the
#   session may continue to execute.
#
#   Moreover, terminating an inactive channel or session does not
#   necessarily close the SSH connection, nor does it prevent a client
#   from requesting another channel of the same type. In particular,
#   expiring an inactive forwarding session does not prevent another
#   identical forwarding from being subsequently created.
#
#   The default is not to expire channels of any type for inactivity.
