# Title: Allow Remote Client to Set Up a Listen Port
# Description:
#
#   'PermitListen' specifies the addresses/ports on
#   which a remote TCP port forwarding may listen.
#
#   The listen specification must be one of the
#   following forms:
#
#     PermitListen port
#     PermitListen host:port
#
#   Multiple permissions may be specified by separating
#   them with whitespace.
#
#   An argument of any can be used to remove all
#   restrictions and permit any listen requests.
#
#   An argument of 'none' can be used to prohibit all
#   listen requests.
#
#   The host name may contain wildcards as described
#   in the PATTERNS section in ssh_config(5).
#
#   The wildcard ‘*’ can also be used in place of a
#   port number to allow all ports.
#
#   'PermitListen' defaults to 'any' which all port
#   forwarding listen requests are permitted.
#
#   NOTE: the GatewayPorts option may further restrict
#         which addresses may be listened on.
#
#   NOTE: ssh(1) will request a listen host of “localhost”
#         if no listen host was specifically requested,
#         and this this name is treated differently to
#         explicit localhost addresses of “127.0.0.1”
#         and “::1”.
#
#   NOTE: Need to compare alongside with 'ListenAddress'.
#
#   NOTE: Need to compare alongside with 'ListenPort'.
