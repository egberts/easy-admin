# Title: Maximum startups by source IP address
# Description:
#
#   'PerSourceMaxStartups' implements limitation on
#   of concurrent unauthenticated connections per
#   source IP address.
#
#   Does the following:
#     *  Mitigating DoS Attacks: By limiting the number of
#        unauthenticated connections from a single source,
#        you can prevent denial-of-service attacks that attempt
#        to exhaust server resources.
#
#   Rate-Limiting: This setting can be used to control the rate
#   at which clients can initiate connections, helping to
#   manage server load.
#
# Considerations
#
#   Compatibility: Ensure that the per-source limit aligns
#   with your network architecture and does not inadvertently
#   block legitimate users.
#
#   Testing: After configuring this setting, monitor the
#   server logs to ensure that it behaves as expected and
#   does not interfere with normal operations.
#
#   The default is 'none'.
