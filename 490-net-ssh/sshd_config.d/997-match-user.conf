# Title: Match By UNIX Username
# Description:
#
#   'Match user' introduces a conditional block.  If all of the
#   criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the
#   keywords on the following lines override those set
#   in the global section of the config file, until
#   either another Match line or the end of the file.
#   If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that
#   are satisfied, only the first instance of the
#   keyword is applied.
#
#   Keyword 'include' statement works well within match files (v8.4).
#
# CLI option: n/a
# Introduced: 5.2
# Obsoleted:
