# Subsystem configures an external subsystem (e.g. file
# transfer daemon).  Arguments should be a subsystem
# name and a command (with optional arguments) to
# execute upon subsystem request.
#
# The command sftp-server implements the SFTP file
# transfer subsystem.
#
# Alternately the name internal-sftp implements an
# in-process SFTP server.  This may simplify
# configurations using ChrootDirectory to force a
# different filesystem root on clients.
#
# By default no subsystems are defined.
#
# WARNING:
#
# Both sftp-server and internal-sftp are part of OpenSSH. 
# The sftp-server is a standalone binary. The internal-sftp is 
# just a configuration keyword that tells sshd to use the SFTP 
# server code built-into the sshd, instead of running another 
# process (what would typically be the sftp-server).
#
# The internal-sftp was added much later (OpenSSH 4.9p1 in 2008?) 
# than the standalone sftp-server binary. But it is the default 
# by now. The sftp-server is now redundant and is kept probably 
# for a backward compatibility.
#
# I believe there's no reason to use the sftp-server for new installations.
#
# NOTE: Debian openssh-server package sets Subsystem
# option to 'sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server' as
# standard in /etc/ssh/sshd_config which are not
# the default in sshd(8):

# AllowAgentForwarding specifies whether ssh-agent(1)
# forwarding is permitted.
# Note: disabling agent forwarding does not improve
# security unless users are also denied shell access,
# as they can always install their own forwarders.
#
# Channel type: agent-forwarding
# CLI option: -o
# options.allow_agent_forwarding
# AllowAgentForwarding defaults to 'yes'.
AllowAgentForwarding no

# AuthorizedPrincipalsFile specifies a file that lists
# principal names that are accepted for certificate
# authentication.  When using certificates signed by a
# key listed in TrustedUserCAKeys, this file lists
# names, one of which must appear in the certificate
# for it to be accepted for authentication.  Names are
# listed one per line preceded by key options (as
# described in AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT in
# sshd(8)).  Empty lines and comments starting with
# ‘#’ are ignored.
#
# Arguments to AuthorizedPrincipalsFile accept the
# tokens described in the TOKENS section.  After
# expansion, AuthorizedPrincipalsFile is taken to be
# an absolute path or one relative to the user's home
# directory.  The default is none, i.e. not to use a
# principals file – in this case, the username of the
# user must appear in a certificate's principals list
# for it to be accepted.
#
# Note that AuthorizedPrincipalsFile is only used when
# authentication proceeds using a CA listed in
# TrustedUserCAKeys and is not consulted for
# certification authorities trusted via
# ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, though the principals= key
# option offers a similar facility (see sshd(8) for
# details).
#
# AuthorizedPrincipalsFile accepts the tokens %%, %h, %U, and %u.
#
# CLI option: -o
# AuthorizedPrincipalsFile defaults to 'none'.
AuthorizedPrincipalsFile none


# PermitListen specifies the addresses/ports on which a
# remote TCP port forwarding may listen.  The listen
# specification must be one of the following forms:
#
#     PermitListen port
#     PermitListen host:port
#
# Multiple permissions may be specified by separating
# them with whitespace.  An argument of any can be used
# to remove all restrictions and permit any listen
# requests.  An argument of none can be used to prohibit
# all listen requests.  The host name may contain
# wildcards as described in the PATTERNS section in
# ssh_config(5).  The wildcard ‘*’ can also be used in
# place of a port number to allow all ports.  By default
# all port forwarding listen requests are permitted.
# NOTE: the GatewayPorts option may further restrict
#       which addresses may be listened on.
# NOTE: ssh(1) will request a listen host of “localhost”
#       if no listen host was specifically requested,
#       and this this name is treated differently to
#       explicit localhost addresses of “127.0.0.1”
#       and “::1”.
#
# CLI option: -o
# options.permitted_listens[]
# PermitListen defaults to 'any'.
PermitListen none

# PermitOpen specifies the destinations to which TCP
# port forwarding is permitted.  The forwarding
# specification must be one of the following forms:
#
#     PermitOpen host:port
#     PermitOpen IPv4_addr:port
#     PermitOpen [IPv6_addr]:port
#
# Multiple forwards may be specified by separating them
# with whitespace.  An argument of any can be used to
# remove all restrictions and permit any forwarding
# requests.  An argument of none can be used to
# prohibit all forwarding requests.  The wildcard ‘*’
# can be used for host or port to allow all hosts or
# ports, respectively.  By default all port forwarding
# requests are permitted.
#
# CLI option: -o
# options.permitted_opens[]
# PermitOpen defaults to 'any'.
#
# Now 'none' due to CVE-2021-28041
PermitOpen none

# KbdInteractiveAuthentication specifies whether to
# allow keyboard-interactive authentication.  The
# argument to this keyword must be yes or no.
# KbdInteractiveAuthentication default is to use
# whatever value ChallengeResponseAuthentication is
# set to (which is also default yes).
#
# CLI option: -o

# StreamLocalBindUnlink specifies whether to remove an
# existing Unix-domain socket file for local or remote
# port forwarding before creating a new one.  If the
# socket file already exists and StreamLocalBindUnlink
# is not enabled, sshd will be unable to forward the
# port to the Unix-domain socket file.  This option is
# only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain
# socket file.

# Match introduces a conditional block.  If all of the
# criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the
# keywords on the following lines override those set
# in the global section of the config file, until
# either another Match line or the end of the file.
# If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that
# are satisfied, only the first instance of the
# keyword is applied.
#
# The arguments to Match are one or more
# criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which
# matches all criteria.  The available criteria are
# User, Group, Host, LocalAddress, LocalPort, RDomain,
# and Address (with RDomain representing the
# rdomain(4) on which the connection was received.)
#
# The match patterns may consist of single entries or
# comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and
# negation operators described in the PATTERNS section
# of ssh_config(5).
#
# The patterns in an Address criteria may additionally
# contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen
# format, such as 192.0.2.0/24 or 2001:db8::/32.
# NOTE: the mask length provided must be consistent
#       with the address - it is an error to specify a
#       mask length that is too long for the address
#       or one with bits set in this host portion of
#       the address.  For example, 192.0.2.0/33 and
#       192.0.2.0/8, respectively.
#
# Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines
# following a Match keyword.
# Available keywords are:
#     AcceptEnv, AllowAgentForwarding, AllowGroups,
#     AllowStreamLocalForwarding, AllowTcpForwarding,
#     AllowUsers, AuthenticationMethods,
#     AuthorizedKeysCommand, AuthorizedKeysCommandUser,
