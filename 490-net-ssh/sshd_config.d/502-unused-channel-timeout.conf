# Title: Unused Connection Timeouts
# Description:
#
#   Specifies whether and how quickly sshd(8) should close
#   client connections with no open channels. Open channels
#   include active shell, command execution or subsystem
#   sessions, connected network, socket, agent or X11
#   forwardings. Forwarding listeners, such as those from the
#   ssh(1) -R flag, are not considered as open channels and
#   do not prevent the timeout. The timeout value is
#   specified in seconds or may use any of the units
#   documented in the TIME FORMATS section.
#
#   Note that this timeout starts when the client connection
#   completes user authentication but before the client has an
#   opportunity to open any channels. Caution should be used
#   when using short timeout values, as they may not provide
#   sufficient time for the client to request and open its
#   channels before terminating the connection.
#
#   The default none is to never expire connections for having
#   no open channels. This option may be useful in conjunction
#   with ChannelTimeout.
#
