# Match introduces a conditional block.  If all of the
# criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the
# keywords on the following lines override those set
# in the global section of the config file, until
# either another Match line or the end of the file.
# If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that
# are satisfied, only the first instance of the
# keyword is applied.
#
# The arguments to Match are one or more
# criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which
# matches all criteria.  The available criteria are
# User, Group, Host, LocalAddress, LocalPort, RDomain,
# and Address (with RDomain representing the
# rdomain(4) on which the connection was received.)
#
# The match patterns may consist of single entries or
# comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and
# negation operators described in the PATTERNS section
# of ssh_config(5).
#
# The patterns in an Address criteria may additionally
# contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen
# format, such as 192.0.2.0/24 or 2001:db8::/32.
# NOTE: the mask length provided must be consistent
#       with the address - it is an error to specify a
#       mask length that is too long for the address
#       or one with bits set in this host portion of
#       the address.  For example, 192.0.2.0/33 and
#       192.0.2.0/8, respectively.
#
# Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines
# following a Match keyword.
# Available keywords are:
#     AcceptEnv, AllowAgentForwarding, AllowGroups,
#     AllowStreamLocalForwarding, AllowTcpForwarding,
#     AllowUsers, AuthenticationMethods,
#     AuthorizedKeysCommand, AuthorizedKeysCommandUser,
#     AuthorizedKeysFile, AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand,
#     AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser,
#     AuthorizedPrincipalsFile, Banner,
#     ChrootDirectory, ClientAliveCountMax,
#     ClientAliveInterval, DenyGroups, DenyUsers,
#     ForceCommand, GatewayPorts, GSSAPIAuthentication,
#     HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes,
#     HostbasedAuthentication,
#     HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly, IPQoS,
#     KbdInteractiveAuthentication,
#     KerberosAuthentication, LogLevel, MaxAuthTries,
#     MaxSessions, PasswordAuthentication,
#     PermitEmptyPasswords, PermitListen, PermitOpen,
#     PermitRootLogin, PermitTTY, PermitTunnel,
#     PermitUserRC, PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes,
#     PubkeyAuthentication, RekeyLimit, RevokedKeys,
#     RDomain, SetEnv, StreamLocalBindMask,
#     StreamLocalBindUnlink, TrustedUserCAKeys,
#     X11DisplayOffset, X11Forwarding and
