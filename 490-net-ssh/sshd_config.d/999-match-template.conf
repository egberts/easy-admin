# Title: Template for a Match
# Description:
#
#   'Match' introduces a conditional block.  If all of the
#   criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the
#   keywords on the following lines override those set
#   in the global section of the config file, until
#   either another Match line or the end of the file.
#   If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that
#   are satisfied, only the first instance of the
#   keyword is applied.
#
#   The arguments to Match are one or more
#   criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which
#   matches all criteria.  The available criteria are
#   User, Group, Host, LocalAddress, LocalPort, RDomain,
#   and Address (with RDomain representing the
#   rdomain(4) on which the connection was received.)
#
#   The match patterns may consist of single entries or
#   comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and
#   negation operators described in the PATTERNS section
#   of sshd_config(5).
#
#   NOTE: the mask length provided must be consistent
#       with the address - it is an error to specify a
#       mask length that is too long for the address
#       or one with bits set in this host portion of
#       the address.  For example, 192.0.2.0/33 and
#       192.0.2.0/8, respectively.
#
#   Keyword 'include' statement works well within match files (v8.4).
#
#   Available 'Match' keyword qualifiers are:
#       User
#       Group
#       Address
#       Host
#       LocalPort
#       RDomain
#
#   Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines
#   following a Match keyword.
#
#   Available 'Match'-permitted keywords are:
#    AcceptEnv, AllowAgentForwarding,
#    AllowGroups, AllowStreamLocalForwarding,
#    AllowTcpForwarding, AllowUsers, AuthenticationMethods,
#    AuthorizedKeysCommand, AuthorizedKeysCommandUser,
#    AuthorizedKeysFile, AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand,
#    AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser,
#    AuthorizedPrincipalsFile, Banner,
#    CASignatureAlgorithms,
#    ChannelTimeout,
#    ChrootDirectory, ClientAliveCountMax,
#    ClientAliveInterval, DenyGroups,
#    DenyUsers, DisableForwarding, ExposeAuthInfo,
#    ForceCommand, GatewayPorts,
#    GssApiAuthentication, GssApiCleanupCredentials,
#    GssStrictAcceptorCheck, HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms,
#    HostbasedAuthentication,
#    HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly,
#    IgnoreRhosts, Include, IPQos,
#    KbdInteractiveAuthentication,
#    LogLevel, MaxAuthTries,
#    MaxSessions, PAMServiceName,
#    PermitEmptyPasswords, PermitListen, PermitOpen,
#    PermitRootLogin, PermitTTY, PermitTunnel,
#    PermitUserRC,
#    PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms, PubkeyAuthentication,
#    PubkeyAuthOptions, RefuseConnection,
#    RekeyLimit, RevokedKeys,
#    SetEnv,
#    StreamLocalBindMask,
#    StreamLocalBindUnlink,
#    TrustedUserCAKeys,
#    UnusedConnectionTimeout, UseDNS, UsePAM,
#    VersionAddendum, X11DisplayOffset, X11Forwarding,
#    X11UseLocalhost, XAuthLocation
