# Title: Permit a destination to do TCP port forwarding
# Description:
#
#   'PermitOpen' specifies the destinations to which TCP
#   port forwarding is permitted.  The forwarding
#   specification must be one of the following forms:
#
#       PermitOpen host:port
#       PermitOpen IPv4_addr:port
#       PermitOpen [IPv6_addr]:port
#
#   Multiple forwards may be specified by separating them
#   with whitespace.  An argument of any can be used to
#   remove all restrictions and permit any forwarding
#   requests.  
#
#   An argument of 'none' can be used to prohibit all
#   forwarding requests.  
#
#   The wildcard ‘*’ can be used for host or port to allow
#   all hosts or ports, respectively.  By default all port
#   forwarding requests are permitted.
#
#   PermitOpen defaults to 'any'.
#
#   WARNING: Security mandates 'none' due to CVE-2021-28041
#
#   WARNING: SSH Bastion mode always requires the option
#          'PermitOpen' to be restricted to just
#          the desired internal target host(s) and
#          never by the options 'any' nor '*' (wildcard).
