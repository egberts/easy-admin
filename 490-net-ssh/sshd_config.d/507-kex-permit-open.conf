# PermitOpen specifies the destinations to which TCP
# port forwarding is permitted.  The forwarding
# specification must be one of the following forms:
#
#     PermitOpen host:port
#     PermitOpen IPv4_addr:port
#     PermitOpen [IPv6_addr]:port
#
# Multiple forwards may be specified by separating them
# with whitespace.  An argument of any can be used to
# remove all restrictions and permit any forwarding
# requests.  An argument of none can be used to
# prohibit all forwarding requests.  The wildcard ‘*’
# can be used for host or port to allow all hosts or
# ports, respectively.  By default all port forwarding
# requests are permitted.
#
# CLI option: -o
# options.permitted_opens[]
# PermitOpen defaults to 'any'.
#
# Now 'none' due to CVE-2021-28041
PermitOpen none
