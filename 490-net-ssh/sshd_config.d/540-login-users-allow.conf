# Title: Allow a list of users
# Description:
#
#   'AllowUsers' keyword can be followed by a
#   list of user name patterns, separated by
#   spaces.
#
#   If specified, login is allowed only for
#   user names that match one of the patterns.
#
#   Only user names are valid;
#   a numerical user ID is not recognized.
#
#   By default, login is allowed for all users.
#   If the pattern takes the form USER@HOST then
#   USER and HOST are separately checked,
#   restricting logins to particular users from
#   particular hosts.  HOST criteria may
#   additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR
#   address/masklen format.
#
#   The allow/deny directives are processed in
#   the following order:
#
#       DenyUsers,
#       AllowUsers,
#       DenyGroups, and
#       AllowGroups.
#
#   AllowUsers default is not to use its keyword.
