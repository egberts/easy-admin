# AllowUsers keyword can be followed by a
# list of user name patterns, separated by
# spaces.
#
# If specified, login is allowed only for
# user names that match one of the patterns.
#
# Only user names are valid;
# a numerical user ID is not recognized.
#
# By default, login is allowed for all users.
# If the pattern takes the form USER@HOST then
# USER and HOST are separately checked,
# restricting logins to particular users from
# particular hosts.  HOST criteria may
# additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR
# address/masklen format.
#
# The allow/deny directives are processed in
# the following order:
#     DenyUsers,
#     AllowUsers,
#     DenyGroups, and
#     AllowGroups.
#
# AllowUsers default is not to use its keyword.
#
# CLI option: -o AllowUsers=
# config.allow_users[]/allowed_user()
# Default: no default (not used)
