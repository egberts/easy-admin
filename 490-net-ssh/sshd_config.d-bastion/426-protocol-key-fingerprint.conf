# Title: Select Hash Algorithm for Fingerprinting
# Description:
#
#   FingerprintHash specifies the hash algorithm used
#   when logging key fingerprints.
#
#   Also used to compare against queried SSHFP resource 
#   record data provided by its DNS server as referenced by 
#   its hostname
#
#   Valid options are: md5 and sha256.
#
#   FingerprintHash defaults to 'sha256'.
#
# Channel type: kex2 (pre-auth)
# CLI option: -o FingerprintHash=md5
# CLI option: -o FingerprintHash=sha256
# Process context: sshconnect2/main()/daemon
