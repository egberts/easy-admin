# Title: X11 Support
# Mode: SSH bastion server
# Description:
#
#   X11Forwarding specifies whether X11 forwarding is
#   permitted.  
#
#   The argument must be yes or no.
#
#   'X11Forwarding' defaults to no.
#
#   When X11 forwarding is enabled, there may be
#   additional exposure to the server and to client
#   displays if the sshd(8) proxy display is configured
#   to listen on the wildcard address (see
#   X11UseLocalhost), though this is not the default.
#   Additionally, the authentication spoofing and
#   authentication data verification and substitution
#   occur on the client side.  The security risk of
#   using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11
#   display server may be exposed to attack when the SSH
#   client requests forwarding (see the warnings for
#   ForwardX11 in ssh_config(5)).  A system
#   administrator may have a stance in which they want
#   to protect clients that may expose themselves to
#   attack by unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding,
#   which can warrant a no setting.
#
#   Note that disabling X11 forwarding does not prevent
#   users from forwarding X11 traffic, as users can
#   always install their own forwarders.
#
# NOTE: Debian openssh-server package sets X11Forwarding
#       option to 'yes' as standard in # /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#       which are not the default in sshd(8).
#
# CLI option: -o X11Forwarding=<boolean>
# Variable: options.x11_forwarding
# Source (read): session_setup_x11fwd()
#
# WARNING: SSH Bastion mode always requires the option 
#          'X11Forwarding' to be disabled ('no').
X11Forwarding no

#   XAuthLocation specifies the full pathname of the
#   xauth(1) program, or none to not use one.
#
#   XAuthLocation defaults to '/usr/bin/xauth'.
#
# CLI option: -oXauthLocation=<filespec>
# Variable: options.xauth_location
# Source (read): session_setup_x11fwd()
#
XauthLocation /usr/bin/xauth

#   X11DisplayOffset specifies the first display number
#   available for sshd(8)'s X11 forwarding.  This prevents
#   sshd from interfering with real X11 servers.
#
#   X11DisplayOffset defaults to '10'.
#
# CLI option: -oX11DisplayOffset=<server-id>
# Variable: options.x11_display_offset
# Source (read): session_setup_x11fwd()
#
X11DisplayOffset 10

#   X11UseLocalhost specifies whether sshd(8) should bind
#   the X11 forwarding server to the loopback address or
#   to the wildcard address.  By default, sshd binds the
#   forwarding server to the loopback address and sets
#   the hostname part of the DISPLAY environment variable
#   to localhost.  This prevents remote hosts from
#   connecting to the proxy display.  However, some older
#   X11 clients may not function with this configuration.
#   X11UseLocalhost may be set to no to specify that the
#   forwarding server should be bound to the wildcard
#   address.  The argument must be yes or no.
#
#   X11UseLocalhost defaults to 'yes'.
#
# CLI option: -o X11UseLocalhost=<boolean>
# Variable: options.x11_use_localhost
# Source (read): session_setup_x11fwd()
#
X11UseLocalhost yes
