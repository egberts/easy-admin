# Title: Maximum SSH Sessions Allowed
# Mode: SSH bastion server
# Description:
#
#   MaxSessions specifies the maximum number of open
#   shell, login or subsystem (e.g. sftp) sessions
#   permitted per network connection.  Multiple sessions
#   may be established by clients that support connection
#   multiplexing.  
#
#   Setting MaxSessions to 1 will effectively disable 
#   session multiplexing, whereas setting it to 0 
#   will prevent all shell, login and subsystem 
#   sessions while still permitting forwarding.
#
# WARNING: Common Criteria 7.1, PCI-DSS, and CISecurity require
#          login audit on all SSH sessions.
#          Increasing the MaxSessions to greater than 1 will
#          circumvent auditing of any hijacked SSH sessions.
#          Keep it at 'MaxSessions 1' (checked as of 8.7_p1
#          at the latest version).
#
#   MaxSessions defaults to '10'.
