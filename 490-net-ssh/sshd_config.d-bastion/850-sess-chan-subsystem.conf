# Title: SSH Subsystem
# Description:
#
#   Subsystem configures an external subsystem 
#   (e.g. file transfer daemon).  
#
#   Arguments should be a subsystem name and 
#   a command (with optional arguments) to
#   execute upon subsystem request.
#
#   The command sftp-server implements the SFTP file
#   transfer subsystem.
#
#   Alternately the name internal-sftp implements an
#   in-process SFTP server.  This may simplify
#   configurations using ChrootDirectory to force a
#   different filesystem root on clients.
#
#   By default no subsystems are defined.
#
# WARNING:
#   Both sftp-server and internal-sftp are part of OpenSSH. 
#   The sftp-server is a standalone binary. The internal-sftp is 
#   just a configuration keyword that tells sshd to use the SFTP 
#   server code built-into the sshd, instead of running another 
#   process (what would typically be the sftp-server).
#
#   The internal-sftp was added much later (OpenSSH 4.9p1 in 2008?) 
#   than the standalone sftp-server binary. But it is the default 
#   by now. The sftp-server is now redundant and is kept probably 
#   for a backward compatibility.
#
#   There is probably no reason to use the sftp-server 
#   for new installations.
#
# NOTE: Debian openssh-server package sets Subsystem
#       option to 'sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server' as
#       standard in /etc/ssh/sshd_config which are not
#       the default in sshd(8):
#
#   Subsystem defaults to 'none'.
