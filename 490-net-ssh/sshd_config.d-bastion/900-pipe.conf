# Title: Allow the Forwarding of Local Streams
# Description:
#
#---------------------------------------------------
# SSH Session Method #4 - Streamlocal via pipe
#---------------------------------------------------
#   AllowStreamLocalForwarding specifies whether
#   StreamLocal (Unix-domain socket) forwarding is
#   permitted.  
#
#   The available options are yes (the default) or 
#   all to allow StreamLocal forwarding, no to 
#   prevent all StreamLocal forwarding, local to
#   allow local (from the perspective of ssh(1))
#   forwarding only or remote to allow remote forwarding
#   only.
#
# NOTE: Disabling StreamLocal forwarding does not
#       improve security unless users are also denied 
#       shell access, as they can always install 
#       their own forwarders.
#
#   AllowStreamLocalForwarding defaults to 'yes'.
#
#   'AllowStreamLocalForwarding' option may be used 
#   after the 'Match' statement and within its
#   'Match' block portion of sshd_config(5)
#   configuration file.
#
# CLI option: -oAllowStreamLocalForwarding=<boolean>
#
AllowStreamLocalForwarding yes

#   StreamLocalBindMask sets the octal file creation mode
#   mask (umask) used when creating a Unix-domain socket
#   file for local or remote port forwarding.  This
#   option is only used for port forwarding to a
#   Unix-domain socket file.
#
#   The default value is 0177, which creates a
#   Unix-domain socket file that is readable and writable
#   only by the owner.  Note that not all operating
#   systems honor the file mode on Unix-domain
#   socket files.
#
#   StreamLocalBindMask defaults to '0177'.
#
# CLI option: -o StreamLocalBindMask=
# Variable: options.allow_streamlocal_forwarding
#
StreamLocalBindMask 0177
