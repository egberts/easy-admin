# Title: 
# Description:
#
#   ControlPersist, when used in conjunction with 
#   ControlMaster, specifies that the master 
#   connection should remain open in the background 
#   (waiting for future client connections) after 
#   the initial client connection has been closed.  
#
#   If set to 'no', then the master connection will 
#   not be placed into the background, and will 
#   close as soon as the initial client connection 
#   is closed.  
#
#   If set to 'yes' or 0, then the master connection 
#   will remain in the background indefinitely (until 
#   killed or closed via a mechanism such as the 
#   "ssh -O exit").  
#
#   If set to a time in seconds, or a time in any of 
#   the formats documented in sshd_config(5), then the 
#   backgrounded master connection will automatically 
#   terminate after it has remained idle (with no 
#   client connections) for the specified time. 
#
#   ControlMaster turns on SSH session multiplexing, 
#   i.e. once a connection is made from a client to a 
#   specific SSH host/port/user, subsequent SSH 
#   connections from the same client to the same 
#   destination will actually “timeshare” the 
#   existing connection; each SSH session gets a 
#   separate shell, but the traffic for all 
#   connection runs over the original “master 
#   connection”:
#
#   Default is not to specify ControlPersist
#
#   Must use 'ControlMaster' with 'ControlPersist'.
