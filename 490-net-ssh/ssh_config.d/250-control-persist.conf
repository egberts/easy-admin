# Title: Controls How Master SSH Control Channel Stays Up
# Description:
#
#   'ControlPersist', when used in conjunction with
#   'ControlMaster', specifies that the master
#   connection should remain open in the background
#   (waiting for future client connections) after
#   the initial client connection has been closed.
#
#   If set to 'false', then the master connection will
#   not be placed into the background, and will
#   close as soon as the initial client connection
#   is closed.
#
#   If set to 'true', then the master connection
#   will remain in the background indefinitely (until
#   killed or closed via a mechanism such as the
#   "ssh -O exit").
#
#   If set to a time in seconds, or a time in any of
#   the formats documented in sshd_config(5), then the
#   backgrounded master connection will automatically
#   terminate after it has remained idle (with no
#   client connections) for the specified time.
#
#   'ControlMaster' turns on SSH session multiplexing,
#   i.e. once a connection is made from a client to a
#   specific SSH host/port/user, subsequent SSH
#   connections from the same client to the same
#   destination will actually “timeshare” the
#   existing connection; each SSH session gets a
#   separate shell, but the traffic for all
#   connection runs over the original “master
#   connection”:
#
#   Default is not to specify 'ControlPersist'.
#
#   Must use 'ControlMaster' with 'ControlPersist'.
#
#   'ControlPersist' is incompatible with 'UpdateHostKeys'
#   being set to 'ask', and will be disabled if it
#   is enabled.
#
#   WARNING: Locking the Unix user account does not prevent
#   remote network SSH login if ControlPersist is
#   set to 'yes'.
