# This setting is explicitly set within this file to
# be at a permanent and unchangable system-wide level
# in order to ensure that it cannot be overridden later by a user
# using ssh(1) either through its own
# '$HOME/.ssh/config' file, or through command-line options
# like '-oSshOptionName=' or '-Fmy_ssh_config_file'.
#
# From a security perspective, ssh client settings is
# not a form of strong security: this means that the
# SSH server and its 'sshd_config'-related config
# file(s) remains to be the strongest control of
# OS securedness.  One can create a private SSH client
# to circumvent all this client-side settings between
# user-level and system-level.
