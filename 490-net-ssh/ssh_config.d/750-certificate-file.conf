# Title: Certificates File Locations
# Description:
#
#   CertificateFile specifies a file from which the 
#   user's certificate is read.  
#
#   A corresponding private key must be provided 
#   separately in order to use this certificate 
#   either from:
#
#   - an IdentityFile directive or -i flag 
#   to ssh(1), 
#   - via ssh-agent(1), or 
#   - via a PKCS11Provider.
#
#   Arguments to CertificateFile may use the tilde 
#   syntax to refer to a user's home directory or 
#   the following tokens also described in the 
#   TOKENS section:
#
#       %%, %C, %d, %h, %i, %k, %L, %l, %n, %p, %r, and %u
#
#   It is possible to have multiple certificate 
#   files specified in configuration files; these 
#   certificates will be tried in sequence.  
#
#   Multiple CertificateFile directives will add to 
#   the list of certificates used for authentication.
#
#   There is a maximum number of certificate files
#   supported and it is compiled-in at 100.
