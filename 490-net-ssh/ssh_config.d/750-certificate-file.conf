# CertificateFile specifies a file from which the user
#    's certificate is read.  A corresponding private 
#    key must be provided separately in order to use 
#    this certificate either from an IdentityFile 
#    directive or -i flag to ssh(1), via 
#    ssh-agent(1), or via a PKCS11Provider.
#
#    Arguments to CertificateFile may use the tilde 
#    syntax to refer to a user's home directory or 
#    the tokens described in the TOKENS section.
#
#    It is possible to have multiple certificate 
#    files specified in configuration files; these 
#    certificates will be tried in sequence.  
#    Multiple CertificateFile directives will add to 
#    the list of certificates used for authentication.
