# Title: Forward Agent 
# Description:
#
#   ForwardAgent specifies whether the connection to 
#   the authentication agent (if any) will be 
#   forwarded to the remote machine.  
#
#   The argument must be yes or no (the default).
# 
#   Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  
#
#   Users with the ability to bypass file 
#   permissions on the remote host (for the agent's 
#   UNIX-domain socket) can access the local agent 
#   through the forwarded connection.  An attacker 
#   cannot obtain key material from the agent, 
#   however they can perform operations on the keys 
#   that enable them to authenticate using the 
#   identities loaded into the agent.
#
#   Security conscience folks would NOT enable this 
#   setting unless FIDO2 or AskPass mechanism is 
#   implemented firsly.
