# Title: Fork After Authentication
# Description:
#
#   'ForkAfterAuthentication' requests ssh to go to
#   background just before command execution.
#
#   This is useful if ssh is going to ask for
#   passwords or passphrases, but the user wants it
#   in the background.
#
#   This implies the 'StdinNull' configuration option
#   being set to 'yes'.
#
#   The recommended way to start X11 programs at a
#   remote site is with something like:
#
#       ssh -f host xterm
#
#   which is the same as ssh host xterm if the
#   'ForkAfterAuthentication' configuration option is
#   set to 'yes'.
#
#   If the 'ExitOnForwardFailure' configuration option
#   is set to “yes”, then a client started with the
#   'ForkAfterAuthentication' configuration option
#   being set to “yes” will wait for all remote port
#   forwards to be successfully established before
#   placing itself in the background.
#
#   The argument to this keyword must be 'yes' (same as
#   the -f option) or 'no' (the default).
#
#   This option only applies to OpenSSH v8.8+
#
# This setting is explicitly set in here at system-wide level
# to ensure that it cannot be overridden by any user's
# own (but attempted replacement) of its value setting,
# either through user's CLI '-o XXXX' or through
# user's '$HOME/.ssh/config'.
#
# CLI option: -f
# CLI option: -oForkAfterAuthentication=<boolean>
# Process context: client
# Network stage: Connection establishment
# Message state: n/a
# Variable: options.fork_after_authentication
#
ForkAfterAuthentication no
