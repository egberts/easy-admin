# Title: User-based Previously Encountered Hostnames
# Description:
#
#   'UserKnownHostsFile' specifies one or more files to
#   use for the user host key database, separated
#   by whitespace.
#
#   The default are all of below:
#
#       ~/.ssh/known_hosts
#       ~/.ssh/known_hosts2
#
#   add a '%k' TOKEN that expands to the effective 'HostKey' of
#   the destination. This allows, e.g., keeping host keys in individual
#   files using "UserKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/known_hosts.d/%k" (v8.4)
#
# Recommendation:
#   UserKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/known_hosts.d/%k
#
