# Title: Client-side Keys locations
# Description:
#
#   IdentityFile specifies a file from which the user's 
#   DSA, ECDSA, Ed25519 or RSA authentication 
#   identity is read.  
#
#   The default are all:
#
#        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa
#        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
#        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
#        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
#
#   Additionally, any identities represented by the 
#   authentication agent will be used for 
#   authentication unless IdentitiesOnly is set.  
#
#   If no certificates have been explicitly 
#   specified by CertificateFile, ssh(1) will try to 
#   load certificate information from the filename 
#   obtained by appending -cert.pub to the path of a 
#   specified IdentityFile.
#
#      /home/johndoe/.ssh/example.com-cert.pub
#
#   Arguments to IdentityFile may use the tilde 
#   syntax to refer to a user's home directory or 
#   the following tokens described also in the 
#   TOKENS section:
#
#       %%, %C, %d, %h, %i, %k, %L, %l, %n, %p, %r, and %u
#
#   It is possible to have multiple identity files 
#   specified in configuration files; all these 
#   identities will be tried in sequence.  Multiple 
#   IdentityFile directives will add to the list of 
#   identities tried (this behaviour differs from 
#   that of other configuration directives).
#
#   There is a maximum number of identity files 
#   supported and that is compiled-in at 100.
