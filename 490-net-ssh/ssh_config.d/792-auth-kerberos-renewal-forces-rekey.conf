# Title: Force rekeying during renewal for Kerberos v5
# Description:
#
#   'GSSAPIRenewalForcesRekey allows SSH sessions to rekey
#   (renegotiate session keys) when the GSSAPI credentials,
#   such as Kerberos tickets, are renewed during an active
#   session. This ensures that the session remains secure and
#   uses the updated credentials for encryption.
#
#   The default is no.
#
#       GSSAPIRenewalForcesRekey no  # maintainer-default
#       GSSAPIRenewalForcesRekey yes  # Debian-default
#
#   During Data Exchange network stage, the data stream can
#   only be either in multiplexing (Mux) or Rekeying state.
#
# CLI option: -oGSSAPIRenewalForcesRekey=<boolean>
# Process context: client
# Network stage: Data exchange
# Message state: TBD
# Variable: options.gss_renewal_rekey
# Source (read): client_loop()/main()

GSSAPIRenewalForcesRekey yes
