# Title: SSH client tag configuration
# Description:
#
# This file defines SSH "Tag" usage for the OpenSSH client.
#
# Tags allow grouping and reuse of SSH client configuration options
# independently of Host patterns. A connection can be associated with
# one or more tags using:
#
#   - The "Tag" keyword inside a Host block, or
#   - The command line option:  ssh -P <tag>
#
# Configuration blocks using:
#
#   Match tagged <tagname>
#
# are applied whenever the connection is associated with that tag.
#
# Tags are evaluated on the client side only and are supported in
# ssh_config (not sshd_config). They are useful for defining reusable
# profiles such as authentication methods, key selection, bastion
# routing, or security policies shared across multiple hosts.
#
# This file is included via /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d and is read in
# lexical order. Later files may override settings defined here.
