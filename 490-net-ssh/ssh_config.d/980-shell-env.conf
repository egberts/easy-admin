# SendEnv specifies what variables from the local 
#    environ(7) should be sent to the server.  The 
#    server must also support it, and the server must 
#    be configured to accept these environment 
#    variables.  
#    Note that the TERM environment variable is 
#    always sent whenever a pseudo-terminal is 
#    requested as it is required by the protocol.  
#    Refer to AcceptEnv in sshd_config(5) for how to 
#    configure the server.  Variables are specified 
#    by name, which may contain wildcard characters.  
#    Multiple environment variables may be separated 
#    by whitespace or spread across multiple 
#    SendEnv directives.
#
#    It is possible to clear previously set SendEnv 
#    variable names by prefixing patterns with -.  
#    The default is not to send any environment 
#    variables.

# SetEnv directly specify one or more environment 
#    variables and their contents to be sent to the 
#    server.  Similarly to SendEnv, the server must 
#    be prepared to accept the environment variable.
