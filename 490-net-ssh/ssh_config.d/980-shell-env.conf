# SetEnv directly specify one or more local 
#    environ(7) (environment variables) and 
#    their contents to be sent to the 
#    server.  Similarly to SendEnv, the server must 
#    be prepared to accept the environment variable.
#
#    The server must also support it, and the server 
#    must be configured to accept these environment 
#    variables.  
#
#    Note that the TERM environment variable is 
#    always sent whenever a pseudo-terminal is 
#    requested as it is required by the protocol.  
#    Refer to AcceptEnv in sshd_config(5) for how to 
#    configure the server.  Variables are specified 
#    by name, which may contain wildcard characters.  
#    Multiple environment variables may be separated 
#    by whitespace or spread across multiple 
#    SendEnv directives.
#
# Be warned that some environment variables could be 
# used to bypass restricted user environments.  
# For this reason, care should be taken in the use 
# of this directive.
#
#    It is possible to clear previously set SendEnv 
#    variable names by prefixing patterns with -.  
#
# Multiple environment variables may be
# separated by whitespace or spread across multiple
# AcceptEnv directives.  
#
# NOTE: Debian openssh-server package sets AcceptEnv
# option to 'LANG LC_*' as standard in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# which are not the default in sshd(8).
#
#    The default is not to send any environment 
#    variables.
