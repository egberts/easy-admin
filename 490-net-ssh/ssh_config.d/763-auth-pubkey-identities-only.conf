# Title: Find Public Key Using Identity
# Description:
#
#   'IdentitiesOnly' specifies that ssh(1) should only
#   use the authentication identity and certificate
#   files explicitly configured in the ssh_config
#   files or passed on the ssh(1) command-line,
#   even if ssh-agent(1) or a 'PKCS11Provider' offers
#   more identities.
#
#   The argument to this keyword must be 'yes' or
#   'no' (the default).
#
#   This option is intended for situations where
#   ssh-agent offers many different identities.
#
# CLI option: -oIdentitiesOnly=<boolean>
# Process context: client
# Network stage: User authentication
# Message state: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST
