# VerifyHostKeyDNS specifies whether to verify the 
#    remote key using DNS and SSHFP resource 
#    records.  
#    If this option is set to yes, the client will 
#    implicitly trust keys that match a secure 
#    fingerprint from DNS.  Insecure fingerprints 
#    will be handled as if this option was set to 
#    ask.  
#    If this option is set to ask, information on 
#    fingerprint match will be displayed, but the 
#    user will still need to confirm new host keys 
#    according to the StrictHostKeyChecking option.  
#    The default is no.  
#    See also VERIFYING HOST KEYS in ssh(1).
# VerifyHostKeyDNS no  # default
# VerifyHostKeyDNS ask
# VerifyHostKeyDNS yes
