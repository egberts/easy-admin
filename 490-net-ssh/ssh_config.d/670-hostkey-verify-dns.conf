# Title: Verify DNS resource record of HostName
# Description:
#
#   VerifyHostKeyDNS specifies whether to verify the 
#   remote key using DNS and SSHFP resource 
#   records.  
#
#   If this option is set to 'yes', the client will 
#   implicitly trust keys that match a secure 
#   fingerprint from DNS.  
#
#   Insecure fingerprints will be handled as if this 
#   option was set to 'ask'.  
#
#   If this option is set to 'ask', information on 
#   fingerprint match will be displayed, but the 
#   user will still need to confirm new host keys 
#   according to the StrictHostKeyChecking option.  
#
#   The default is no.  
#
# WARNING: Always set to "NO".
