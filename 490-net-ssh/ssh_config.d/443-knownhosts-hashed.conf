# Title: Hash File for Previously Encountered Hostnames
# Description:
#
#   'HashKnownHosts' indicates that ssh(1) should hash
#   host names and addresses when they are added to
#   ~/.ssh/known_hosts.
#
#   These hashed names may be used normally by ssh(1)
#   and sshd(8), but they do not reveal identifying
#   information should the file's contents be
#   disclosed.
#
#   The default is no.
#
#   Note that existing names and addresses in known
#   hosts files will not be converted automatically,
#   but may be manually hashed using ssh-keygen(1).
#
#   Use of this option may break facilities such as
#   tab-completion that rely on being able to read
#   unhashed host names from ~/.ssh/known_hosts.
#
# CLI option: -oHashKnownHosts=<boolean>
# Process context: client
# Network stage: Connection establishment
# Message state: n/a
