# Title: Batch Mode
# Description:
#
#   BatchMode, if set to yes, passphrase/password 
#   querying will be disabled.  
#
#   In addition, the ServerAliveInterval option 
#   will be set to 300 seconds by (Debian-specific)
#   default.
#
#   This option is useful in scripts and other batch 
#   jobs where no user is present to supply the 
#   password, and where it is desirable to detect a 
#   broken network swiftly.  
#
#   The argument must be yes or no (the default).
#
# CLI option: -oBatchMode=<boolean>
# Variable: options.batch_mode
