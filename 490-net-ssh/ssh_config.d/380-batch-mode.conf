# Title: Batch Mode
# Description:
#
#   'BatchMode', if set to yes, passphrase/password
#   querying will be disabled.
#
#   In addition, the 'ServerAliveInterval' option
#   will be set to 300 seconds by (Debian-specific)
#   default.
#
#   This option is useful in scripts and other batch
#   jobs where no user is present to supply the
#   password, and where it is desirable to detect a
#   broken network swiftly.
#
#   The argument must be yes or no (the default).
#
#   Used only if 'AuthenticationMethods' has
#   'keyboard-interactive' or 'password' option(s).
#
# CLI option: -oBatchMode=<boolean>
# Process context: client
# Network stage: Connection establishment
# Message state: n/a
# Variable: options.batch_mode
# Source (read): main()
#
