# Title: Allow shell environment variables
# Description:
#
#   'SetEnv' directly specify one or more local
#   environ(7) (environment variables) and their
#   contents to be sent to the server.
#
#   Similarly to 'SendEnv', the server must be prepared
#   to accept the environment variable, with the
#   exception of TERM variable.
#
#   The server must also support it, and the server
#   must be configured to accept these environment
#   variables.
#
#   Note that the TERM environment variable is
#   always sent whenever a pseudo-terminal is
#   requested as it is required by the protocol.
#   Refer to 'AcceptEnv' in sshd_config(5) for how to
#   configure the server.  Variables are specified
#   by name, which may contain wildcard characters.
#   Multiple environment variables may be separated
#   by whitespace or spread across multiple
#   'SendEnv' directives.
#
# Be warned that some environment variables could be
# used to bypass restricted user environments.
# For this reason, care should be taken in the use
# of this directive.
#
#    It is possible to clear previously set 'SetEnv'
#    variable names by prefixing patterns with -.
#
#    The default is not to send any environment
#    variables.
