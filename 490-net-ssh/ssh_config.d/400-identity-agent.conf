# Title: Identity Agent
# Description:
#
#   'IdentityAgent' specifies the UNIX-domain socket used
#   to communicate with the authentication agent
#
#   This option overrides the SSH_AUTH_SOCK
#   environment variable and can be used to select a
#   specific agent.
#
#   Setting the socket name to 'none' disables the
#   use of an authentication agent.
#
#   If the string 'SSH_AUTH_SOCK' is specified, the
#   location of the socket will be read from the
#   SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable.
#
#   Otherwise if the specified value begins with a ‘$’
#   character, then it will be treated as an
#   environment variable containing the location of
#   the socket.
#
#   Arguments to 'IdentityAgent' may use the:
#
#   - tilde syntax to refer to a user's home directory
#   - any shell environment variable
#   - following tokens also described in the TOKENS section
#
#       %%, %C, %d, %h, %i, %k, %L, %l, %n, %p, %r, and %u

# CLI option: -oIdentityAgent=<string>
