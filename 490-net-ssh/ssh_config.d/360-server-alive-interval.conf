# Title: 
# Description:
#
#   ServerAliveInterval sets a timeout interval in 
#   seconds after which if no data has been received 
#   from the server, ssh(1) will send a message 
#   through the encrypted channel to request a 
#   response from the server.
#
#   The default is 0, indicating that these messages 
#   will not be sent to the server, or 300 if the 
#   BatchMode option is set (Debian-specific).  
#
#   ProtocolKeepAlives and SetupTimeOut are 
#   Debian-specific compatibility aliases for 
#   this option.
