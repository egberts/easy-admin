# DynamicForward specifies that a TCP port on the 
#    local machine be forwarded over the secure 
#    channel, and the application protocol is then 
#    used to determine where to connect to from the 
#    remote machine.
#
#    The argument must be [bind_address:]port.  IPv6 
#    addresses can be specified by enclosing 
#    addresses in square brackets.  By default, the 
#    local port is bound in accordance with the 
#    GatewayPorts setting.  However, an explicit 
#    bind_address may be used to bind the connection 
#    to a specific address.  The bind_address of 
#    localhost indicates that the listening port be 
#    bound for local use only, while an empty address 
#    or ‘*’ indicates that the port should be 
#    available from all interfaces.
#
#    Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are 
#    supported, and ssh(1) will act as a SOCKS 
#    server.  Multiple forwardings may be specified, 
#    and additional forwardings can be given on the 
#    command line.  Only the superuser can forward 
#    privileged ports.
