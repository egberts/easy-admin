# Title: Forward Dynamic
# Description:
#
#   DynamicForward specifies that a TCP port on the 
#   local machine be forwarded over the secure 
#   channel, and the application protocol is then 
#   used to determine where to connect to from the 
#   remote machine.
#
#   The argument must be [bind_address:]port.  
#
#   IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing 
#   addresses in square brackets.  
#
#   By default, the local port is bound in accordance 
#   with the GatewayPorts setting.  However, an 
#   explicit bind_address may be used to bind the 
#   connection to a specific address.  
#
#   The bind_address of localhost indicates that the 
#   listening port be bound for local use only, while 
#   an empty address or ‘*’ indicates that the port 
#   should be available from all interfaces.
#
#   Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are 
#   supported, and ssh(1) will act as a SOCKS 
#   server.  Multiple forwardings may be specified, 
#   and additional forwardings can be given on the 
#   command line.  Only the superuser can forward 
#   privileged ports.
