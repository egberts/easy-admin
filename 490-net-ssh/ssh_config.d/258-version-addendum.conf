# Title: Client Version Addendum
# Description:
#
#   'VersionAddendum' specifies an additional string to append
#   to the SSH protocol version identification sent by the client
#   during initial protocol handshake.
#
#   During connection setup:
#     - The client sends its banner:
#         SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_<client_version> [VersionAddendum]
#       where [VersionAddendum] is the configured string.
#     - The server responds with its own banner:
#         SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_<server_version>
#       The client reads this banner and stores it in runtime memory
#       (ssh->remote_version) for protocol compatibility checks and logging.
#
#   Behavior notes:
#     - VersionAddendum affects **only the outgoing client banner**.
#     - It does **not influence** host key algorithm selection,
#       key exchange, cipher negotiation, or any server-side behavior.
#     - The server banner is stored **temporarily in memory**; it is not
#       persisted to ssh_config or any other file.
#
#   Default: empty string (sends unmodified client version banner)
#   Usage: client-side only, valid in:
#     - ssh_config
#     - files included from ssh_config.d
#   Not valid in sshd_config
#
# CLI option: -o VersionAddendum=<string>
