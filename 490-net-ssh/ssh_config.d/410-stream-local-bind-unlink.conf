#
# StreamLocalBindUnlink specifies whether to remove 
#    an existing UNIX-domain socket file for local or 
#    remote port forwarding before creating a new 
#    one.  
#    If the socket file already exists and 
#    StreamLocalBindUnlink is not enabled, ssh will 
#    be unable to forward the port to the 
#    UNIX-domain socket file.  
#    This option is only used for port forwarding to 
#    a UNIX-domain socket file.
#
#    The argument must be yes or no (the default).
