# CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs specifies rules to 
#    determine whether CNAMEs should be followed when 
#    canonicalizing hostnames.  The rules consist of 
#    one or more arguments of 
#    source_domain_list:target_domain_list, where 
#    source_domain_list is a pattern-list of domains 
#    that may follow CNAMEs in canonicalization, and 
#    target_domain_list is a pattern-list of domains 
#    that they may resolve to.
#
#    For example, 
#    "*.a.example.com:*.b.example.com,*.c.example.com" 
#    will allow hostnames matching "*.a.example.com" to 
#    be canonicalized to names in the "*.b.example.com" 
#    or "*.c.example.com" domains.
