# Title: 
# Description:
#
#   ControlPath specify the path to the control socket 
#   used for connection sharing as described in the 
#   ControlMaster section above or the string none 
#   to disable connection sharing.  
#
#   Arguments to ControlPath may use the tilde syntax 
#   to refer to a user's home directory or the 
#   following tokens further described in the TOKENS 
#   section:
#
#       %%, %C, %d, %h, %i, %k, %L, %l, %n, %p, %r, and %u
#
#   It is recommended that any ControlPath used for 
#   opportunistic connection sharing include at 
#   least %h, %p, and %r (or alternatively %C) and be 
#   placed in a directory that is not writable by 
#   other users.  
#
#   This ensures that shared connections are 
#   uniquely identified.
