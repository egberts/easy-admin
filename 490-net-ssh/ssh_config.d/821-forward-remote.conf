# Title: Forward Remote
# Description:
#
#   'RemoteForward' specifies that a TCP port on the
#   remote machine be forwarded over the secure
#   channel.
#
#   The remote port may either be forwarded to a
#   specified host and port from the local machine,
#   or may act as a SOCKS 4/5 proxy that allows a
#   remote client to connect to arbitrary
#   destinations from the local machine.
#
#   The first argument must be [bind_address:]port
#
#   If forwarding to a specific destination then the
#   second argument must be host:hostport, otherwise
#   if no destination argument is specified then the
#   remote forwarding will be established as a SOCKS
#   proxy.
#
#   IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing
#   addresses in square brackets.
#
#   Multiple forwardings may be specified, and
#   additional forwardings can be given on the
#   command line.
#
#   Privileged ports can be forwarded only when
#   logging in as root on the remote machine.
#
#   If the port argument is 0, the listen port will
#   be dynamically allocated on the server and
#   reported to the client at run time.
#

# WARNING: Unless you explicitly configure a 'RemoteForward'
#          directive, no remote port forwarding will occur.
