# RemoteForward specifies that a TCP port on the 
#    remote machine be forwarded over the secure 
#    channel.  The remote port may either be 
#    forwarded to a specified host and port from the 
#    local machine, or may act as a SOCKS 4/5 proxy 
#    that allows a remote client to connect to 
#    arbitrary destinations from the local machine.  
#    The first argument must be [bind_address:]port 
#    If forwarding to a specific destination then the 
#    second argument must be host:hostport, otherwise 
#    if no destination argument is specified then the 
#    remote forwarding will be established as a SOCKS 
#    proxy.
#
#    IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing 
#    addresses in square brackets.  Multiple 
#    forwardings may be specified, and additional 
#    forwardings can be given on the command line.  
#    Privileged ports can be forwarded only when 
#    logging in as root on the remote machine.
#
#    If the port argument is 0, the listen port will 
#    be dynamically allocated on the server and 
#    reported to the client at run time.
