# Title: GSS API for Key Exchange
# Description:
#
#   GSSAPIKeyExchange specifies whether key exchange 
#   based on GSSAPI is allowed. GSSAPI key exchange
#   doesn't rely on ssh keys to verify host identity.
#   The default is no. 
#
#   GSSAuthentication option must be set to 'yes' for 
#   GSSSAPIKeyExchange option to be available.
#
#   GSSAPIKeyExchange option can be used without the
#   proposed server host key option.
