# Title: Impose Timeout on Forwarded X11 Session
# Description:
#
#   'ForwardX11Timeout' specify a timeout for untrusted
#   X11 forwarding using the format described in the
#   TIME FORMATS section of sshd_config(5).
#
#   X11 connections received by ssh(1) after this
#   time will be refused.
#
#   Setting 'ForwardX11Timeout' to zero will disable
#   the timeout and permit X11 forwarding for the
#   life of the connection.
#
#   The default is to disable untrusted X11
#   forwarding after twenty minutes has elapsed.
#
# CLI option: -oForwardX11Timeout=<boolean>
