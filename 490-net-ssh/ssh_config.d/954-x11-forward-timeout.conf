# Title: Impose Timeout on Forwarded X11 Session
# Description:
#
#   ForwardX11Timeout specify a timeout for untrusted 
#   X11 forwarding using the format described in the 
#   TIME FORMATS section of sshd_config(5).  
#
#   X11 connections received by ssh(1) after this 
#   time will be refused.  
#
#   Setting ForwardX11Timeout to zero will disable 
#   the timeout and permit X11 forwarding for the 
#   life of the connection.  
#
#   The default is to disable untrusted X11 
#   forwarding after twenty minutes has elapsed.
