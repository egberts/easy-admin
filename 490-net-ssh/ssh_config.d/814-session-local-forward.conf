# Description:
#
#   LocalForward specifies that a TCP port on the local 
#   machine be forwarded over the secure channel to 
#   the specified host and port from the remote 
#   machine.  
#
#   The first argument must be [bind_address:]port 
#   and the second argument must be host:hostport.  
#   IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing 
#   addresses in square brackets.  
#
#   Multiple forwardings may be specified, and 
#   additional forwardings can be given on the 
#   command line.  
#
#   Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.  
#
#   By default, the local port is bound in accordance 
#   with the GatewayPorts setting.  
#
#   However, an explicit bind_address may be used to 
#   bind the connection to a specific address.  
#   The bind_address of localhost indicates that the 
#   listening port be bound for local use only, while 
#   an empty address or ‘*’ indicates that the port 
#   should be available from all interfaces.
