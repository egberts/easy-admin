# Description:
#
#   CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs specifies rules to 
#   determine whether CNAMEs should be followed when 
#   canonicalizing hostnames.  
#
#   The rules consist of one or more arguments of:
#
#       source_domain_list:target_domain_list
#
#   where source_domain_list is a pattern-list of 
#   domains that may follow CNAMEs in canonicalization, 
#   and target_domain_list is a pattern-list of 
#   domains that they may resolve to.
#
#   For example, 
#
#      *.a.example.com:*.b.example.com,*.c.example.com
#
#   will allow hostnames matching "*.a.example.com" to 
#   be canonicalized to names in the "*.b.example.com" 
#   or "*.c.example.com" domains.
#
#   If CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs is set to 'yes' 
#   then, for connections that do not use a 
#   ProxyCommand or ProxyJump, ssh(1) will attempt to 
#   canonicalize the hostname specified on the 
#   command line using the CanonicalDomains suffixes 
#   and 'CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs' rules.
