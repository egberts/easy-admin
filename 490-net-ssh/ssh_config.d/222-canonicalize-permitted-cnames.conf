# Description:
#
#   CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs specifies rules to 
#   determine whether CNAMEs should be followed when 
#   canonicalizing hostnames.  The rules consist of 
#   one or more arguments of 
#     source_domain_list:target_domain_list, 
#   where source_domain_list is a pattern-list of 
#   domains that may follow CNAMEs in canonicalization, 
#   and target_domain_list is a pattern-list of 
#   domains that they may resolve to.
#
#   For example, 
#      "*.a.example.com:*.b.example.com,*.c.example.com" 
#   will allow hostnames matching "*.a.example.com" to 
#   be canonicalized to names in the "*.b.example.com" 
#   or "*.c.example.com" domains.
