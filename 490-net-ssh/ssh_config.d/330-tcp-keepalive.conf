# Title: 
# Description:
#
#   TCPKeepAlive specifies whether the system should 
#   send TCP keepalive messages to the other side.  
#
#   If they are sent, death of the connection or 
#   crash of one of the machines will be properly 
#   noticed.  
#
#   This option only uses TCP keepalives (as opposed 
#   to using ssh level keepalives), so takes a long 
#   time to notice when the connection dies. As such, 
#   you probably want the ServerAliveInterval 
#   option as well.  
#
#   However, this means that connections will die if 
#   the route is down temporarily, and some people 
#   find it annoying.
# 
#   The default is yes (to send TCP keepalive 
#   messages), and the client will notice if the 
#   network goes down or the remote host dies.  
#
#   This is important in scripts, and many users want 
#   it too.
#
#   To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value 
#   should be set to no.  
#
#   See also ServerAliveInterval for protocol-level 
#   keepalives.

TCPKeepAlive yes
