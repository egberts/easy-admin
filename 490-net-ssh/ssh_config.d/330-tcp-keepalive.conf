# TCPKeepAlive specifies whether the system should 
#    send TCP keepalive messages to the other side.  
#    If they are sent, death of the connection or 
#    crash of one of the machines will be properly 
#    noticed.  This option only uses TCP keepalives 
#    (as opposed to using ssh level keepalives), so 
#    takes a long time to notice when the connection 
#    dies.  As such, you probably want the 
#    ServerAliveInterval option as well.  However, 
#    this means that connections will die if the 
#    route is down temporarily, and some people find 
#    it annoying.
# 
#    The default is yes (to send TCP keepalive 
#    messages), and the client will notice if the 
#    network goes down or the remote host dies.  This 
#    is important in scripts, and many users want 
#    it too.
#
#    To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value 
#    should be set to no.  See also ServerAliveInterval 
#    for protocol-level keepalives.
# TCPKeepAlive yes  # default
TCPKeepAlive yes
