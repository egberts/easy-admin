# Title: Perform Expansion of User-Specified Short Hostname
# Description:
#
#    CanonicalizeHostname controls whether explicit 
#    hostname canonicalization is performed.  
#
#    The default, no, is not to perform any name 
#    rewriting and let the system resolver handle all 
#    hostname lookups.  
#
#    If set to yes then, for connections that do not 
#    use a ProxyCommand or ProxyJump, ssh(1) will 
#    attempt to canonicalize the hostname specified 
#    on the command line using the CanonicalDomains 
#    suffixes and CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs rules.  
#
#    If CanonicalizeHostname is set to 'always', then 
#    canonicalization is applied to proxied 
#    connections too.
#
# Security:
#    Probably do not want accidential pull-ups of lone
#    zone names by some 'search' entries in
#    /etc/resolv.conf, so say 'no' here.
