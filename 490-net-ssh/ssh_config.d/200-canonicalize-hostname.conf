# Title: Perform Expansion of User-Specified Short Hostname
# Description:
#
#    'CanonicalizeHostname' controls whether explicit
#    hostname canonicalization is performed.
#
#    The 'no' default is not to perform any name
#    rewriting and let the system resolver handle all
#    hostname lookups.
#
#    If set to 'yes' then, for connections that do not
#    use a 'ProxyCommand' or 'ProxyJump', ssh(1) will
#    attempt to canonicalize the hostname specified
#    on the command line using the 'CanonicalDomains'
#    suffixes and 'CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs' rules.
#
#    If 'CanonicalizeHostname' is set to 'always', then
#    canonicalization is applied to proxied
#    connections too.
#
# Security:
#    Probably do not want accidental pull-ups of lone
#    zone names by some 'search' entries in
#    /etc/resolv.conf, so say 'no' here.
