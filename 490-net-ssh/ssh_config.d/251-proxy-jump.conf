# Title: Proxy Jump
# Description:
#
#   ProxyJump specifies one or more jump proxies as
#   either [user@]host[:port] or an ssh URI.
#
#   Multiple proxies may be separated by comma
#   characters and will be visited sequentially.
#
#   Setting this option will cause ssh(1) to connect
#   to the target host by first making a ssh(1)
#   connection to the specified ProxyJump host and
#   then establishing a TCP forwarding to the
#   ultimate target from there.
#
#   Note that this option will compete with the
#   ProxyCommand option - whichever is specified
#   first will prevent later instances of the other
#   from taking effect.
#
# NOTE: ProxyCommand is ignored if ProxyJump
#          already specified.
#
# NOTE:  'CanonicalizeHostname' set to 'none' will disables
#        the use of a 'ProxyJump' host.
#
# NOTE:  'ProxyCommand' will be set to 'none' if
#        this 'ProxyJump' option gets used.
