# Title: 
# Description:
#
#   ProxyJump specifies one or more jump proxies as 
#   either [user@]host[:port] or an ssh URI.  
#
#   Multiple proxies may be separated by comma 
#   characters and will be visited sequentially.  
#
#   Setting this option will cause ssh(1) to connect 
#   to the target host by first making a ssh(1) 
#   connection to the specified ProxyJump host and 
#   then establishing a TCP forwarding to the 
#   ultimate target from there.
#
#   Note that this option will compete with the 
#   ProxyCommand option - whichever is specified 
#   first will prevent later instances of the other 
#   from taking effect.
#
# NOTE: ProxyCommand is ignored if ProxyJump 
#          already specified.
#
# NOTE:  'CanonicalizeHostname' set to 'none' will disables
#        the use of a 'ProxyJump' host.
