# Title: 
# Description:
#
#   'ConnectTimeout' specifies the timeout (in seconds)
#   used when connecting to the SSH server, instead
#   of using the default system TCP timeout.
#
#   This timeout is applied both to establishing the
#   connection and to performing the initial SSH
#   protocol handshake and key exchange.
#
#   This value is used only when the target is down or
#   really unreachable, not when it refuses the
#   connection.
