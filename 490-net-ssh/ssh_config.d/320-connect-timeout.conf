# ConnectTimeout specifies the timeout (in seconds) 
#    used when connecting to the SSH server, instead 
#    of using the default system TCP timeout.  This 
#    value is used only when the target is down or 
#    really unreachable, not when it refuses the 
#    connection.
#    Source: options.connect_timeout/main()/ssh.c
# ConnectTimeout 0  # default
