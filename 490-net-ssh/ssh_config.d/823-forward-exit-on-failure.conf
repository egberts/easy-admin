# Title: Exit on Forward Failure
# Description:
#
#   ExitOnForwardFailure specifies whether ssh(1) 
#   should terminate the connection if it cannot set 
#   up all requested dynamic, tunnel, local, and 
#   remote port forwardings, (e.g. if either end is 
#   unable to bind and listen on a specified port).  
#
#   Note that ExitOnForwardFailure does not apply to 
#   connections made over port forwardings and will 
#   not, for example, cause ssh(1) to exit if TCP 
#   connections to the ultimate forwarding 
#   destination fail.  
#
#   The argument must be yes or no (the default).
