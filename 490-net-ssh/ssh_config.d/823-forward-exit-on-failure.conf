# Title: Exit on Forward Failure
# Description:
#
#   'ExitOnForwardFailure' specifies whether ssh(1)
#   should terminate the connection if it cannot set
#   up all requested dynamic, tunnel, local, and
#   remote port forwardings, (e.g. if either end is
#   unable to bind and listen on a specified port).
#
#   Note that 'ExitOnForwardFailure' does not apply to
#   connections made over port forwardings and will
#   not, for example, cause ssh(1) to exit if TCP
#   connections to the ultimate forwarding
#   destination fail.
#
#   The argument must be 'yes' or 'no' (the default).
#
# CLI option: -oExitOnFwdFailure=<boolean>
# Introduced: 5.0
# Obsoleted:
# Process context: client
# Network stage: Session setup
# Message state: TBD
# Variable: options.exit_on_fwd_failure
# Source (read): ssh_init_forwarding()/ssh_session2()/main()
