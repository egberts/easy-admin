# Title: 
# Description:
#
#   UpdateHostKeys specifies whether ssh(1) should accept 
#   notifications of additional hostkeys from the 
#   server sent after authentication has completed and 
#   add them to UserKnownHostsFile.  
#   (new in OpenSSH v8.4r1)
#
#   The argument must be:
#
#   - 'yes', 
#   - 'no' (the default) or 
#   - 'ask'.  
#
#   Enabling this option allows learning alternate 
#   hostkeys for a server and supports graceful key 
#   rotation by allowing a server to send replacement 
#   public keys before old ones are removed.  
#
#   Additional hostkeys are only accepted if the key 
#   used to authenticate the host was already trusted 
#   or explicitly accepted by the user.  
#
#   If UpdateHostKeys is set to 'ask', then the user is 
#   asked to confirm the modifications to the 
#   known_hosts file.  Confirmation is currently 
#   incompatible with 'ControlPersist', and will be 
#   disabled if it is enabled.
# 
#   Presently, only sshd(8) from OpenSSH 6.8 and greater 
#   support the "hostkeys@openssh.com" protocol 
#   extension used to inform the client of all the 
#   server's hostkeys.
#
# CLI option: -oUpdateHostKeys=no   # default
# CLI option: -oUpdateHostKeys=yes
# CLI option: -oUpdateHostKeys=ask
