# Title: Proxy Command
# Description:
#
#   ProxyCommand specifies the command to use to 
#   connect to the server.  The command string 
#   extends to the end of the line, and is executed 
#   using the user's shell ‘exec’ directive to avoid 
#   a lingering shell process.
#
#   Arguments to ProxyCommand accept the following
#   tokens:
#
#      %%, %h, %n, %p, and %r.
#
#   The command can be basically anything, and should 
#   read from its standard input and write to its 
#   standard output.  It should eventually connect an 
#   sshd(8) server running on some machine, or execute 
#   sshd -i somewhere.  Host key management will be 
#   done using the HostName of the host being 
#   connected (defaulting to the name typed by the 
#   user).  Setting the command to none disables 
#   this option entirely.  Note that CheckHostIP is 
#   not available for connects with a proxy command.
#
# NOTE: Ignore ProxyCommand if ProxyJump already 
#          specified.
#
#   This directive is useful in conjunction with 
#   nc(1) and its proxy support.  For example, the 
#   following directive would connect via an HTTP 
#   proxy at 192.0.2.0:
#
#       ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -X connect -x 192.0.2.0:8080 %h %p
#       ProxyCommand ssh -q -W %h:%p gateway.example.com
#
# NOTE: 'ProxyJump' option will compete with 
#       the ProxyCommand option - whichever is 
#       specified first will prevent later 
#       instances of the other from taking effect.
