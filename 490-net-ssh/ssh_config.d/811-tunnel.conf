# Title: Enable SSH Tunneling Mode
# Description:
#
#   Tunnel request tun(4) device forwarding between the 
#   client and the server.  
#
#   The tunneling mode argument must be:
#     'yes',
#     'point-to-point' (layer 3),
#     'ethernet' (layer 2), or
#     'no' (the default).
#
#   Specifying 'yes' requests the default tunnel mode, 
#   which is 'point-to-point'.
#
#   If 'no', then 'TunnelDevice' option gets ignored.
#
# CLI option: -w [ yes | point-to-point | ethernet | no ]
# CLI option: -oTunnel= [ yes | point-to-point | ethernet | no ]
# Process context: client
# Network stage: Session setup
# Message state: TBD
