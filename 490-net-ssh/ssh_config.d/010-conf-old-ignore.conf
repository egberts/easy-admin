# Title: Ignore Badly Configured SSH_CONFIG settings
# Description:
#
#   'IgnoreUnknown' specifies a pattern-list of unknown
#   options to be ignored if they are encountered
#   in configuration parsing.
#
#   This may be used to suppress errors if
#   ssh_config contains options that are unrecognised
#   by ssh(1).
#
#   This option also covers user-specific
#   '$HOME/.ssh/config' ssh(1) config settings
#   as well.
#
#   It is recommended that 'IgnoreUnknown' be listed
#   early in the configuration file as it will not
#   be applied to unknown options that appear
#   before it.
#
# CLI option: -oIgnoreUnknown=<string>
