# Title: Ignore Badly Configured SSH_CONFIG settings
# Description:
#
#   IgnoreUnknown specifies a pattern-list of unknown 
#   options to be ignored if they are encountered 
#   in configuration parsing.  
#
#   This may be used to suppress errors if 
#   ssh_config contains options that are unrecognised 
#   by ssh(1).  
#
#   This option also covers user-specific 
#   '$HOME/.ssh/config' ssh(1) config settings
#   as well.
#
#   It is recommended that IgnoreUnknown be listed 
#   early in the configuration file as it will not 
#   be applied to unknown options that appear 
#   before it.
#
# CLI option: -oIgnoreUnknown=<string>
# Variable: options.ignored_unknown
# Source: parse_token()
