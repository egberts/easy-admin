# Title: Permit Local Command
# Description:
#
#   'LocalCommand' specifies a command to execute on the
#   local machine after successfully connecting to
#   the server.
#
#   The command string extends to the end of the
#   line, and is executed with the user's shell.
#
#   Arguments to 'LocalCommand' accept the following
#   tokens also described in the TOKENS section:
#
#       %%, %C, %d, %h, %i, %k, %L, %l, %n, %p, %r, and %u
#
#   The command is run synchronously and does not
#   have access to the session of the ssh(1) that
#   spawned it.
#
#   It should not be used for interactive commands.
#
#   This directive is ignored unless
#   'PermitLocalCommand' has been enabled.
#
