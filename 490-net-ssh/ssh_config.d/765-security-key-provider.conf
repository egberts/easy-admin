# Title: Security Key Provider
# Description:
#
#   'SecurityKeyProvider' specifies a path to a library
#   that will be used when loading any FIDO
#   authenticator-hosted keys, overriding the default
#   of using the built-in USB HID support.
#
#   If the specified value begins with a ‘$’
#   character, then it will be treated as an
#   environment variable containing the path to the
#   library.
#
#   When using a FIDO-based key (sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com
#   or sk-ed25519@openssh.com), OpenSSH uses this directive to
#   load the appropriate shared object (dynamic library) that
#   handles communication with the hardware device.
#
#   'CertificateFile' specifies a file from which the
#   user's certificate is read.
#
#   A corresponding private key must be provided
#   separately (from 'CertificateFile') in order to
#   use this certificate either from an 'IdentityFile'
#   directive or -i flag to ssh(1), via ssh-agent(1),
#   or via a 'PKCS11Provider' or 'SecurityKeyProvider'.
#
#   'IdentitiesOnly' specifies that ssh(1) should only
#   use the configured authentication identity and
#   certificate files (either the default files, or
#   those explicitly configured in the ssh_config
#   files or passed on the ssh(1) command-line), even
#   if ssh-agent(1) or a 'PKCS11Provider' or
#   'SecurityKeyProvider' offers more identities.
#
#   Check 'ssh -Q key | grep sk' for FIDO2 support.
