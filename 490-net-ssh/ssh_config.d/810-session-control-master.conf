# Title: Multiplex All SSH Sessions over Single TCP Connection
# Description:
#
#   'ControlMaster' enables the sharing of multiple
#   sessions over a single network connection.
#
#   When set to 'yes', ssh(1) will listen for
#   connections on a control socket specified using
#   the 'ControlPath' argument.
#
#   Additional sessions can connect to this socket
#   using the same 'ControlPath' with 'ControlMaster' set
#   to 'no' (the default).
#
#   These sessions will try to reuse the master
#   instance's network connection rather than
#   initiating new ones, but will fall back
#   to connecting normally if the control socket
#   does not exist, or is not listening.
#
#   Setting this to 'ask' will cause ssh(1) to listen
#   for control connections, but require
#   confirmation using ssh-askpass(1). If the
#   'ControlPath' cannot be opened, ssh(1) will
#   continue without connecting to a master
#   instance.
#
#   X11 and ssh-agent(1) forwarding is supported
#   over these multiplexed connections, however the
#   display and agent forwarded will be the one
#   belonging to the master connection i.e. it is
#   not possible to forward multiple displays or
#   agents.
#
#   Two additional options allow for opportunistic
#   multiplexing: try to use a master connection
#   but fall back to creating a new one if one does
#   not already exist. These options are:
#
#   - 'auto' and
#   - 'autoask'
#
#   The 'autoask' requires confirmation like the ask option.
#
