# Title: Perform Strict Check of Hostkey
# Description:
#
#   StrictHostKeyChecking, if this flag is set to yes, 
#   ssh(1) will never automatically add host keys to 
#   the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, and refuses to 
#   connect to hosts whose host key has changed.  
#
#   This provides maximum protection against 
#   man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, though it can 
#   be annoying when the /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts 
#   file is poorly maintained or when connections 
#   to new hosts are frequently made.  
#
#   This option forces the user to manually 
#   add all new hosts.
#
#   If this flag is set to “accept-new” then ssh 
#   will automatically add new host keys to the user 
#   known hosts files, but will not permit 
#   connections to hosts with changed host keys.  
#
#   If this flag is set to “no” or “off”, ssh will 
#   automatically add new host keys to the user 
#   known hosts files and allow connections to hosts 
#   with changed hostkeys to proceed, subject to 
#   some restrictions.  
#
#   If this flag is set to ask (the default), new 
#   host keys will be added to the user known host 
#   files only after the user has confirmed that is 
#   what they really want to do, and ssh will refuse 
#   to connect to hosts whose host key has changed.  
#
#   The host keys of known hosts will be verified 
#   automatically in all cases.
#
#   StrictHostKeyChecking yes
#   StrictHostKeyChecking ask  # default
