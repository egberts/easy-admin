# Title: Hostkeys Algorithms
# Description:
#
#   HostKeyAlgorithms specifies the host key algorithms 
#   that the client wants to use in order of 
#   preference.  
#
#   Alternately if the specified value begins with 
#   a ‘+’ character, then the specified key types 
#   will be appended to the default set instead of 
#   replacing them.  
#
#   If the specified value begins with a ‘-’ character, 
#   then the specified key types (including wildcards) 
#   will be removed from the default set instead of 
#   replacing them.  
#
#   The default for this HostKeyAlgorithms 
#   (OpenSSH v8.4r1) option are:
# 
#     ssh-ed25519,
#     ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,  # (new)
#     sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com,  # (new)
#     sk-ssh-ed25519-cert-v01@openssh.com,  # (new)
#     ssh-rsa,
#     ssh-dss,  # (new)
#     ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,
#     ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,
#     ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
#     sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com, (new)
#     ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com,
#     ssh-dss-cert-v01@openssh.com, (new)
#     ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com,
#     ecdsa-sha2-nistp384-cert-v01@openssh.com,
#     ecdsa-sha2-nistp521-cert-v01@openssh.com,
#     sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com, (new)
#
#  Dropped from OpenSSH v7.8r1:
#     rsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com, (dropped frrom v7.8r1)
#     rsa-sha2-256-cert-v01@openssh.com, (dropped frrom v7.8r1)
#     rsa-sha2-512, (dropped frrom v7.8r1)
#     rsa-sha2-256, (dropped frrom v7.8r1)
#
#    If hostkeys are known for the destination host 
#        then this default is modified to prefer their algorithms.
#
#   The list of available key algorithms may also be
#   obtained by executing:
#
#         ssh -Q key
#
# CLI option: -oHostKeyAlgorithms=<string>
# Process context: client
# Network stage: Key Exchange (KEX) negotiation
# Message state: n/a
# Variable: options.hostkeyalgorithms

#### Most don't use certificates in association with SSH

# Not yet in OpenSSH v8.0 - sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com

# IDEAL: Place PK certificate algos in front of non-cert algos
