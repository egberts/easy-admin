# HostKeyAlgorithms specifies the host key algorithms 
#    that the client wants to use in order of 
#    preference.  Alternately if the specified value 
#    begins with a ‘+’ character, then the specified 
#    key types will be appended to the default set 
#    instead of replacing them.  If the specified 
#    value begins with a ‘-’ character, then the 
#    specified key types (including wildcards) will 
#    be removed from the default set instead of 
#    replacing them.  The default for this option is:

#
#    If hostkeys are known for the destination host 
#        then this default is modified to prefer their algorithms.
#
#    The list of available key types may also be obtained using:
#         "ssh -Q key" command.
