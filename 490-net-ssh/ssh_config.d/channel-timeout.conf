# Title: Per-channel inactivity timeout control
# Description:
#
#   'ChannelTimeout' specifies inactivity timeouts applied to
#   individual SSH channel types after authentication.
#
#   Syntax:
#
#     ChannelTimeout <type>=<interval>[,<type>=<interval>...]
#
#   Where <type> is a channel type name (e.g. session, exec,
#   subsystem, direct-tcpip, forwarded-tcpip) and <interval>
#   is a time value in seconds, or a time format supported by
#   sshd (e.g. 10m, 1h).
#
#   When a channel exceeds its inactivity interval, it is
#   forcibly closed by the server.
#
#   Warnings:
#     - Aggressive values may terminate legitimate long-lived
#       but idle sessions.
#     - Does not replace transport-level keepalive settings.
