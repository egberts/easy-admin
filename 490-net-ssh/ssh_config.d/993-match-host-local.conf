# Host restricts the following declarations (up to
#    the next Host or Match keyword) to be only for
#    those hosts that match one of the patterns given
#    after the keyword.  If more than one pattern is
#    provided, they should be separated by
#    whitespace.  A single ‘*’ as a pattern can be
#    used to provide global defaults for all hosts.
#    The host is usually the hostname argument given
#    on the command line (see the
#    CanonicalizeHostname keyword for exceptions).
#
#    A pattern entry may be negated by prefixing it
#    with an exclamation mark (‘!’).  If a negated
#    entry is matched, then the Host entry is
#    ignored, regardless of whether any other
#    patterns on the line match.  Negated matches are
#    therefore useful to provide exceptions for
#    wildcard matches.
