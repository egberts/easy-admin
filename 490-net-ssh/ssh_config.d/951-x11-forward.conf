# Title: Forward X11 Session
# Description:
#
#   'ForwardX11' specifies whether X11 connections
#   will be automatically redirected over the secure
#   channel and DISPLAY set.
#
#   The argument must be 'yes' or 'no' (the default).
#
#   X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.
#
#   Users with the ability to bypass file permissions
#   on the remote host (for the user's X11
#   authorization database) can access the local X11
#   display through the forwarded connection.
#
#   An attacker may then be able to perform
#   activities such as keystroke monitoring if the
#   'ForwardX11Trusted' option is also enabled.
#
#   Specifying 'ForwardX11Trusted' enables 'ForwardX11'.
#
#   For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to
#   X11 SECURITY extension restrictions by default.
#   Please refer to the ssh -Y op‚Äê tion and the
#   ForwardX11Trusted directive in ssh_config(5) for
#   more information.
#
#   (Debian-specific: X11 forwarding is not subjected
#   to X11 SECURITY extension restrictions by default,
#   because too many programs currently crash in this
#   mode.
#
#   Set the 'ForwardX11Trusted' option to 'no' to
#   restore the upstream behaviour.
#   This may change in future depending on
#   client-side improvements.)
#
#   If the 'ForwardAgent' variable is set to 'yes' (or
#   see the description of the -A and -a options)
#   and the user is using an authentication agent,
#   the X11 connection to the agent is automatically
#   forwarded to the remote side.
#
# CLI option: -x  # no
# CLI option: -X  # yes
# CLI option: -Y  # turns on -X
# CLI option: -oForwardX11=<boolean>
