# Title: Forward X11 Session
# Description:
#
#   ForwardX11 specifies whether X11 connections 
#   will be automatically redirected over the secure 
#   channel and DISPLAY set.  
#
#   The argument must be 'yes' or 'no' (the default).
#
#   X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  
#
#   Users with the ability to bypass file permissions 
#   on the remote host (for the user's X11 
#   authorization database) can access the local X11 
#   display through the forwarded connection.  
#
#   An attacker may then be able to perform 
#   activities such as keystroke monitoring if the 
#   ForwardX11Trusted option is also enabled.
#
# Option: -x
# Option: -X
# Process context: ssh(client)
# State: SSH2_MSG_SESSION_SETUP?
