# Title: Forward Gateway Ports
# Description:
#
#   GatewayPorts specifies whether remote hosts are 
#   allowed to connect to local forwarded ports.  
#
#   By default, ssh(1) binds local port forwardings 
#   to the loopback address.  This prevents other 
#   remote hosts from connecting to forwarded ports.  
#   GatewayPorts can be used to specify that ssh 
#   should bind local port forwardings to the 
#   wildcard address, thus allowing remote hosts to 
#   connect to forwarded ports.  
#
#   The argument must be yes or no (the default).
#
# CLI option: -g <boolean>
# CLI option: -oGatewayPorts=<boolean>
# Variable: options.fwd_opts.gateway_ports
