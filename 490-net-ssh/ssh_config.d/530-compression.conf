# Title: Compression
# Description:
#
#   'Compression' specifies whether to use compression.
#
#   The argument must be 'yes' or 'no' (the default).
#
#   'Compression' keyword requests compression of all
#   data (including stdin, stdout, stderr, and data
#   for forwarded X11, TCP and UNIX-domain connections).
#
#   The compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1).
#
#   'Compression' is desirable on modem lines and other
#   slow connections, but will only slow down things
#   on fast networks.
#
#   The default value can be set on a host-by-host
#   basis in the configuration files
#
# SECURITY: 'Compression' leaves tell-tale fingerprinting
#           for keystroke analysis
#
# CLI option: -C
# CLI option: -oCompression=<multistate-yes-no-???>
# Process context: client
# Network stage: Key Exchange (KEX) negotiation
# Message state: n/a
