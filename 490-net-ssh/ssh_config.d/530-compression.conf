# Title: Compression
# Description:
#
#   Compression specifies whether to use compression.  
#
#   The argument must be yes or no (the default).
#
#   'Compression' keyword requests compression of all 
#   data (including stdin, stdout, stderr, and data 
#   for forwarded X11, TCP and UNIX-domain connections).  
#
#   The compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1).  
#
#   Compression is desirable on modem lines and other 
#   slow connections, but will only slow down things 
#   on fast networks.  
#
#   The default value can be set on a host-by-host 
#   basis in the configuration files
#
# NOTE: Compression leaves tell-tale fingerprinting 
#       for keystroke analysis
#
# CLI option: -C
# CLI option: -oCompression=<multistate-yes-no-???>
# Parameter: multistate_compression/parse_multistate
