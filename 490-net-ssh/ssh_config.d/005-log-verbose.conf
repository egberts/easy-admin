# Title: LogVerbose specify one or more overrides to LogLevel.
# Description:
#
#   'LogVerbose' allows forcing maximum debug logging by
#   file/function/line pattern-lists.
#
#   An override consists of a pattern lists that
#   matches the source file, function and line number
#   to force detailed logging for.
#
#   For example, an override pattern of:
#
#       kex.c:*:1000,*:kex_exchange_identification():*,packet.c:*
#
#   would enable detailed logging for line 1000 of kex.c,
#   everything in the kex_exchange_identification() function, and all
#   code in the packet.c file.
#
#   'LogVerbose' option is intended for debugging and no
#   overrides are enabled by default.
#
# CLI option: -oLogVerbose=none
# CLI option: -oLogVerbose=<string>
