# Title: LogVerbose specifys one or more overrides to LogLevel.  
# Description:
#
#   Allows forcing maximum debug logging by file/function/line
#   pattern-lists.
#
#   An override consists of a pattern lists that 
#   matches the source file, function and line number 
#   to force detailed logging for.
#
#   For example, an override pattern of:
#
#       kex.c:*:1000,*:kex_exchange_identification():*,packet.c:*
#
#   would enable detailed logging for line 1000 of 
#   kex.c, everything in the 
#   kex_exchange_identification() function, and all 
#   code in the packet.c file.  
#
#   This option is intended for debugging and no 
#   overrides are enabled by default.
#
# CLI option: -oLogVerbose=none
# CLI option: -oLogVerbose=<string>
