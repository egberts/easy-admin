# Title: 
# Description:
#
#   'CheckHostIP', if set to yes (the default), ssh(1)
#   will additionally check the host IP address in
#   the known_hosts file.
#
#   This allows it to detect if a host key changed
#   due to DNS spoofing and will add addresses of
#   destination hosts to 
#
#       ~/.ssh/known_hosts
#
#   in the process, regardless of the setting of
#   'StrictHostKeyChecking'.
#
#   If the option is set to no, the check will not
#   be executed.
#
# NOTE: 'CheckHostIP' is disabled if connected to
#       localhost only VIA PROXY.
#
# CLI option: -oCheckHostIP=<boolean>
