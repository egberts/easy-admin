# Title: Assign HotKey for Exiting SSH Session
# Description:
#
#   'EscapeChar' sets the escape character (default: ‘~’).
#
#   The escape character can also be set on the
#   command line.
#
#   The argument should be a single character, ‘^’
#   followed by a letter, or 'none' to disable the
#   escape character entirely (making the connection
#   transparent for binary data).
#
#   The supported escapes (assuming the default ‘~’) are:
#
#     ~.   Disconnect.
#
#     ~^Z  Background ssh.
#
#     ~#   List forwarded connections.
#
#     ~&   Background ssh at logout when waiting for
#          forwarded connection / X11 sessions to
#          terminate.
#
#     ~?   Display a list of escape characters.
#
#     ~B   Send a BREAK to the remote system (only
#          useful if the peer supports it).
#
#     ~C   Open command line.  Currently this allows
#          the addition of port forwardings using
#          the -L, -R and -D options (see above).
#          It also allows the cancellation of
#          existing port-forwardings with:
#
#             -KL[bind_address:]port for local,
#             -KR[bind_address:]port for remote and
#             -KD[bind_address:]port for dynamic port-forwardings.
#
#          !command allows the user to execute a
#          local command if the PermitLocalCommand
#          option is enabled in ssh_config(5).
#          Basic help is available, using the -h option.
#
#     ~R   Request rekeying of the connection (only
#          useful if the peer supports it).
#
#     ~V   Decrease the verbosity (LogLevel) when
#          errors are being written to stderr.
#
#     ~v   Increase the verbosity (LogLevel) when
#          errors are being written to stderr.
