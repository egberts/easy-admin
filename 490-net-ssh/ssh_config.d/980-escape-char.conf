# Description:
#
#   EscapeChar sets the escape character (default: ‘~’).  
#
#   The escape character can also be set on the 
#   command line.  
#
#   The argument should be a single character, ‘^’ 
#   followed by a letter, or 'none' to disable the 
#   escape character entirely (making the connection 
#   transparent for binary data).
