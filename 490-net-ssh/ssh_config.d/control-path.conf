# Title: Control socket path for connection multiplexing
# Description:
#
#   'ControlPath' specifies the file specification path for the
#   control master.
#
#   Specifies the filesystem path used for the control socket when
#   connection multiplexing is enabled via ControlMaster. The client
#   will listen on this socket and other client instances can reuse
#   the existing connection rather than re-establishing a new one.
#   Path may include tokens like %h (host), %r (remote user), %p (port). 
#   Valid values: any usable filesystem path template that resolves at runtime.
#
# CLI option: -o ControlPath=<path>
