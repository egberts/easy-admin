#                   Useful as a catch-all block.
#    canonical    - Matches if hostname was canonicalized 
#                   (via 'CanonicalizeHostname' setting).
#    exec         - Executes a command; block matches if the 
#                   command returns exit code 0.
#    host         - Matches the hostname being connected to 
#                   (after hostname alias resolution).
#    originalhost - Matches the original hostname entered on 
#                   the command line (before aliases).
#    user         - Matches the remote user specified with 'User' or 
#                   on the command line.
#    localuser    - Matches the local system user running the ssh command.
