# Title: Interval to Rescramble Cipher Key
# Description:
#
#   'RekeyLimit' specifies the maximum amount of data
#   that may be transmitted before the session key is
#   renegotiated, optionally followed a maximum
#   amount of time that may pass before the session
#   key is renegotiated.
#
#   The first argument is specified in bytes and may
#   have a suffix of ‘K’, ‘M’, or ‘G’ to indicate
#   Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively.
#
#   The default is between ‘1G’ and ‘4G’, depending
#   on the cipher.
#
#   The optional second value is specified in seconds
#   and may use any of the units documented in the
#   TIME FORMATS section of sshd_config(5).
#
#   The default value for 'RekeyLimit' is 'none',
#   which means that rekeying is performed after the
#   cipher's default amount of data has been sent or
#   received and no time based rekeying is done.
#
#   Default of RekeyLimit is 1G and 1h
#
#   Minimum size of data parameter is 16 bytes.
#
# CLI option: -oRekeyLimit=default none
# CLI option: -oRekeyLimit=<16 to 2**64-1> <time-interval>
