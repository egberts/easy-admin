# Title: Interval to Rescramble Cipher Key
# Description:
#
#   RekeyLimit specifies the maximum amount of data 
#   that may be transmitted before the session key is 
#   renegotiated, optionally followed a maximum 
#   amount of time that may pass before the session 
#   key is renegotiated.  
#
#   The first argument is specified in bytes and may 
#   have a suffix of ‘K’, ‘M’, or ‘G’ to indicate 
#   Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes, respectively.  
#
#   The default is between ‘1G’ and ‘4G’, depending 
#   on the cipher.  
#
#   The optional second value is specified in seconds 
#   and may use any of the units documented in the 
#   TIME FORMATS section of sshd_config(5).  
#
#   The default value for RekeyLimit is default none, 
#   which means that rekeying is performed after the 
#   cipher's default amount of data has been sent or 
#   received and no time based rekeying is done.
#
#   Default of RekeyLimit is 1G and 1h
