# Title: Trusted those Forward X11 Session
# Description:
#
#   'ForwardX11Trusted', if this option is set to 'yes',
#   (the Debian-specific default), remote X11
#   clients will have full access to the original
#   X11 display.
#
#   If this option is set to no (the upstream default),
#   remote X11 clients will be considered untrusted
#   and prevented from stealing or tampering with
#   data belonging to trusted X11 clients.
#
#   Furthermore, the xauth(1) token used for the
#   session will be set to expire after 20 minutes.
#   Remote clients will be refused access after
#   this time.
#
#   See the X11 SECURITY extension specification for
#   full details on the restrictions imposed on
#   untrusted clients.
#
#   Specifying 'ForwardX11Trusted' enables 'ForwardX11'.
#
#   (Debian-specific: In the default configuration,
#   this option is equivalent to -X, since
#   'ForwardX11Trusted' defaults to “yes” as described
#   above.
#
#   Set the 'ForwardX11Trusted' option to 'no' to
#   restore the upstream behaviour.  This may change
#   in future depending on client-side improvements.)
#
# CLI option: -Y  # also enables -X
# CLI option: -oForwardX11Trusted=<boolean>
# Introduced: 5.0
