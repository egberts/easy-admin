# Title: Try the unqualified using system resolver if canonicalization failed
# Description:
#
#   CanonicalizeFallbackLocal specifies whether to 
#   fail with an error when hostname canonicalization 
#   fails.  
#
#   The default, 'yes', will attempt to look up the 
#   unqualified hostname using the system resolver's 
#   search rules.  
#
#   A value of 'no' will cause ssh(1) to fail 
#   instantly if CanonicalizeHostname is enabled and 
#   the target hostname cannot be found in any of the 
#   domains specified by CanonicalDomains.
#
# Option: -oCanonicalizeFallbackLocal=
# Source: resolve_canonicalize()/ssh.c

CanonicalizeFallbackLocal yes
