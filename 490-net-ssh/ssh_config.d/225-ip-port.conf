# Title: Set IP port number globally
# Description:
#
#   'Port' specifies the port number to connect on the
#   remote host.
#
#   Using this setting will force end-user to
#   use the '-p 2345' option for 'ssh' command.
#
#   The default is 22.
#
#   The parameter must be a positive integer less
#   than 65536.
#
# NOTE: Once you set this 'Port' here, none of the
#       Match/Host will be able to change this setting.
