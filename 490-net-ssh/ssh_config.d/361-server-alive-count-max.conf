# Title: Maxium Count of Server Alive Before SSH Disconnection
# Description:
#
#   ServerAliveCountMax sets the number of server alive 
#   messages (see below) which may be sent without 
#   ssh(1) receiving any messages back from the 
#   server.  
#
#   If this threshold is reached while server alive 
#   messages are being sent, ssh will disconnect from 
#   the server, terminating the session.  
#
#   It is important to note that the use of server 
#   alive messages is very different from 
#   TCPKeepAlive (below).  
#
#   The server alive messages are sent through the 
#   encrypted channel and therefore will not be 
#   spoofable.  
#
#   The TCP keepalive option enabled by TCPKeepAlive 
#   is spoofable.  
#
#   The server alive mechanism is valuable when the 
#   client or server depend on knowing when a 
#   connection has become inactive.
#
#   The default value is 3.  
#
#   If, for example, ServerAliveInterval (see below) 
#   is set to 15 and ServerAliveCountMax is left at 
#   the default, if the server becomes unresponsive, 
#   ssh will disconnect after approximately 45 seconds.
#
# CLI option: -oServerAliveCountMax=<integer>
# Variable: options.server_alive_count_max
#
ServerAliveCountMax 3
