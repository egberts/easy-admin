# RevokedHostKeys specifies revoked host public keys.  
#    Keys listed in this file will be refused for 
#    host authentication.  
#    Note that if this file does not exist or is not 
#    readable, then host authentication will be 
#    refused for all hosts.  
#    Keys may be specified as a text file, listing 
#    one public key per line, or as an OpenSSH Key 
#    Revocation List (KRL) as generated by 
#    ssh-keygen(1).  
#    For more information on KRLs, see the KEY 
#    REVOCATION LISTS section in ssh-keygen(1).
