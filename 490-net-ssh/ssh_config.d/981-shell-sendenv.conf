# Path: /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d
# Title: Allow shell environment variables
# Description:
#
#   SendEnv specifies what variables from the local 
#   environ(7) should be sent to the server.  
#   The server must also support it, and the server 
#   must be configured to accept these environment 
#   variables.  
#
# NOTE: the TERM environment variable is always sent 
#       whenever a pseudo-terminal is requested as it 
#       is required by the protocol.  
#
#   Refer to AcceptEnv in sshd_config(5) for how to 
#   configure the server.  
#
#   Variables are specified by name, which may 
#   contain wildcard characters.  Multiple 
#   environment variables may be separated by 
#   whitespace or spread across multiple SendEnv 
#   directives.
#
#   See PATTERNS for more information on patterns.
#
#   It is possible to clear previously set SendEnv 
#   variable names by prefixing patterns with -.  
#
#   The default is not to send any environment 
#   variables.
#
# CLI option: -oSendEnv=<string>=<value>
# State: SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_REQ
# Variable: options.num_send_env
# Variable: options.send_env[]
# Source: session_env_req()/session_input_channel_req()/server_input_channel_req()
#
#
# SendEnv defaults to accept any environment variables.
