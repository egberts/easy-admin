#
# pool name [option]...
#   The syntax of this directive is similar to that for the server
#   directive, except that it is used to specify a pool of NTP servers
#   rather than a single NTP server. The pool name is expected to
#   resolve to multiple addresses which might change over time.
#
#   This directive can be used multiple times to specify multiple
#   pools.
#
#   All options valid in the server directive can be used in this
#   directive too. There is one option specific to the pool directive:
#
#   maxsources sources
#       This option sets the desired number of sources to be used from
#       the pool. chronyd will repeatedly try to resolve the name until
#       it gets this number of sources responding to requests. The
#       default value is 4 and the maximum value is 16.
#
#   When an NTP source is unreachable, marked as a falseticker, or has
#   a distance larger than the limit set by the maxdistance directive,
#   chronyd will try to replace the source with a newly resolved
#   address of the name.
#
#   An example of the pool directive is
#
#   pool pool.ntp.org iburst maxsources 3

    cat << DROPIN_CONF_EOF | $SUDO_BIN tee -a "$FILESPEC" >/dev/null
# server hostname [option]...
#   The server directive specifies an NTP server which can be used as a
#   time source. The client-server relationship is strictly
#   hierarchical: a client might synchronise its system time to that of
#   the server, but the serverâ€™s system time will never be influenced
#   by that of a client.
#
#   This directive can be used multiple times to specify multiple
#   servers.
#
#   The directive is immediately followed by either the name of the
#   server, or its IP address. It supports the following options:
#
#   minpoll poll
#     This option specifies the minimum interval between requests
#     sent to the server as a power of 2 in seconds. For example,
#     minpoll 5 would mean that the polling interval should not drop
#     below 32 seconds. The default is 6 (64 seconds), the minimum is
#     -6 (1/64th of a second), and the maximum is 24 (6 months). Note
#     that intervals shorter than 6 (64 seconds) should generally not
#     be used with public servers on the Internet, because it might
#     be considered abuse. A sub-second interval will be enabled only
#     when the server is reachable and the round-trip delay is
#     shorter than 10 milliseconds, i.e. the server should be in a
#     local network.
#
#   maxpoll poll
#     This option specifies the maximum interval between requests
#     sent to the server as a power of 2 in seconds. For example,
#     maxpoll 9 indicates that the polling interval should stay at or
#     below 9 (512 seconds). The default is 10 (1024 seconds), the
#     minimum is -6 (1/64th of a second), and the maximum is 24 (6
#     months).
#
#   iburst
#     With this option, chronyd will start with a burst of 4-8
#     requests in order to make the first update of the clock sooner.
#     It will also repeat the burst every time the source is switched
#     from the offline state to online with the online command in
#     chronyc.
#
#   burst
#     With this option, chronyd will send a burst of up to 4 requests
#     when it cannot get a good measurement from the server. The
#     number of requests in the burst is limited by the current
#     polling interval to keep the average interval at or above the
#     minimum interval, i.e. the current interval needs to be at
#     least two times longer than the minimum interval in order to
#     allow a burst with two requests.
#
#   key ID
#     The NTP protocol supports a message authentication code (MAC)
#     to prevent computers having their system time upset by rogue
#     packets being sent to them. The MAC is generated as a function
#     of a key specified in the key file, which is specified by the
#     keyfile directive.
#
#     The key option specifies which key (with an ID in the range 1
#     through 2^32-1) should chronyd use to authenticate requests
#     sent to the server and verify its responses. The server must
#     have the same key for this number configured, otherwise no
#     relationship between the computers will be possible.
#
#     If the server is running ntpd and the output size of the hash
#     function used by the key is longer than 160 bits (e.g. SHA256),
#     the version option needs to be set to 4 for compatibility.
#
#   nts
#     This option enables authentication using the Network Time
#     Security (NTS) mechanism. Unlike with the key option, the
#     server and client do not need to share a key in a key file. NTS
#     has a Key Establishment (NTS-KE) protocol using the Transport
#     Layer Security (TLS) protocol to get the keys and cookies
#     required by NTS for authentication of NTP packets.
#
#   maxdelay delay
#     chronyd uses the network round-trip delay to the server to
#     determine how accurate a particular measurement is likely to
#     be. Long round-trip delays indicate that the request, or the
#     response, or both were delayed. If only one of the messages was
#     delayed the measurement error is likely to be substantial.
#
#     For small variations in the round-trip delay, chronyd uses a
#     weighting scheme when processing the measurements. However,
#     beyond a certain level of delay the measurements are likely to
#     be so corrupted as to be useless. (This is particularly so on
#     dial-up or other slow links, where a long delay probably
#     indicates a highly asymmetric delay caused by the response
#     waiting behind a lot of packets related to a download of some
#     sort).
#
#     If the user knows that round trip delays above a certain level
#     should cause the measurement to be ignored, this level can be
#     defined with the maxdelay option. For example, maxdelay 0.3
#     would indicate that measurements with a round-trip delay of 0.3
#     seconds or more should be ignored. The default value is 3
#     seconds and the maximum value is 1000 seconds.
#
#   maxdelayratio ratio
#     This option is similar to the maxdelay option above. chronyd
#     keeps a record of the minimum round-trip delay amongst the
#     previous measurements that it has buffered. If a measurement
#     has a round trip delay that is greater than the maxdelayratio
#     times the minimum delay, it will be rejected.
#
#   maxdelaydevratio ratio
#     If a measurement has a ratio of the increase in the round-trip
#     delay from the minimum delay amongst the previous measurements
#     to the standard deviation of the previous measurements that is
#     greater than the specified ratio, it will be rejected. The
#     default is 10.0.
#
#   mindelay delay
#     This option specifies a fixed minimum round-trip delay to be
#     used instead of the minimum amongst the previous measurements.
#     This can be useful in networks with static configuration to
#     improve the stability of corrections for asymmetric jitter,
#     weighting of the measurements, and the maxdelayratio and
#     maxdelaydevratio tests. The value should be set accurately in
#     order to have a positive effect on the synchronisation.
#
#   asymmetry ratio
#     This option specifies the asymmetry of the network jitter on
#     the path to the source, which is used to correct the measured
#     offset according to the delay. The asymmetry can be between
#     -0.5 and +0.5. A negative value means the delay of packets sent
#     to the source is more variable than the delay of packets sent
#     from the source back. By default, chronyd estimates the
#     asymmetry automatically.
#
#   offset offset
#     This option specifies a correction (in seconds) which will be
#     applied to offsets measured with this source. Itâ€™s particularly
#     useful to compensate for a known asymmetry in network delay or
#     timestamping errors. For example, if packets sent to the source
#     were on average delayed by 100 microseconds more than packets
#     sent from the source back, the correction would be -0.00005
#     (-50 microseconds). The default is 0.0.
#
#   minsamples samples
#     Set the minimum number of samples kept for this source. This
#     overrides the minsamples directive.
#
#   maxsamples samples
#     Set the maximum number of samples kept for this source. This
#     overrides the maxsamples directive.
#
#   filter samples
#     This option enables a median filter to reduce noise in NTP
#     measurements. The filter will reduce the specified number of
#     samples to a single sample. It is intended to be used with very
#     short polling intervals in local networks where it is
#     acceptable to generate a lot of NTP traffic.
#
#   offline
#     If the server will not be reachable when chronyd is started,
#     the offline option can be specified. chronyd will not try to
#     poll the server until it is enabled to do so (by using the
#     online command in chronyc).
#
#   auto_offline
#     With this option, the server will be assumed to have gone
#     offline when sending a request fails, e.g. due to a missing
#     route to the network. This option avoids the need to run the
#     offline command from chronyc when disconnecting the network
#     link. (It will still be necessary to use the online command
#     when the link has been established, to enable measurements to
#     start.)
#
#   prefer
#     Prefer this source over sources without the prefer option.
#
#   noselect
#     Never select this source. This is particularly useful for
#     monitoring.
#
#   trust
#     Assume time from this source is always true. It can be rejected
#     as a falseticker in the source selection only if another source
#     with this option does not agree with it.
#
#   require
#     Require that at least one of the sources specified with this
#     option is selectable (i.e. recently reachable and not a
#     falseticker) before updating the clock. Together with the trust
#     option this might be useful to allow a trusted authenticated
#     source to be safely combined with unauthenticated sources in
#     order to improve the accuracy of the clock. They can be
#     selected and used for synchronisation only if they agree with
#     the trusted and required source.
#
#   xleave
#     This option enables the interleaved mode of NTP. It enables the
#     server to respond with more accurate transmit timestamps (e.g.
#     kernel or hardware timestamps), which cannot be contained in
#     the transmitted packet itself and need to refer to a previous
#     packet instead. This can significantly improve the accuracy and
#     stability of the measurements.
#
#     The interleaved mode is compatible with servers that support
#     only the basic mode. Note that even servers that support the
#     interleaved mode might respond in the basic mode as the
#     interleaved mode requires the servers to keep some state for
#     each client and the state might be dropped when there are too
#     many clients (e.g. clientloglimit is too small), or it might be
#     overwritten by other clients that have the same IP address
#     (e.g. computers behind NAT or someone sending requests with a
#     spoofed source address).
#
#     The xleave option can be combined with the presend option in
#     order to shorten the interval in which the server has to keep
#     the state to be able to respond in the interleaved mode.
#
#   polltarget target
#     Target number of measurements to use for the regression
#     algorithm which chronyd will try to maintain by adjusting the
#     polling interval between minpoll and maxpoll. A higher target
#     makes chronyd prefer shorter polling intervals. The default is
#     8 and a useful range is from 6 to 60.
#
#   port port
#     This option allows the UDP port on which the server understands
#     NTP requests to be specified. For normal servers this option
#     should not be required (the default is 123, the standard NTP
#     port).
#
#   ntsport port
#     This option specifies the TCP port on which the server is
#     listening for NTS-KE connections when the nts option is
#     enabled. The default is 4460.
#
#   presend poll
#     If the timing measurements being made by chronyd are the only
#     network data passing between two computers, you might find that
#     some measurements are badly skewed due to either the client or
#     the server having to do an ARP lookup on the other party prior
#     to transmitting a packet. This is more of a problem with long
#     sampling intervals, which might be similar in duration to the
#     lifetime of entries in the ARP caches of the machines.
#
#     In order to avoid this problem, the presend option can be used.
#     It takes a single integer argument, which is the smallest
#     polling interval for which an extra pair of NTP packets will be
#     exchanged between the client and the server prior to the actual
#     measurement. For example, with the following option included in
#     a server directive:
#
#         presend 9
#
#     when the polling interval is 512 seconds or more, an extra NTP
#     client packet will be sent to the server a short time (2
#     seconds) before making the actual measurement.
#
#     If the presend option is used together with the xleave option,
#     chronyd will send two extra packets instead of one.
#
#   minstratum stratum
#     When the synchronisation source is selected from available
#     sources, sources with lower stratum are normally slightly
#     preferred. This option can be used to increase stratum of the
#     source to the specified minimum, so chronyd will avoid
#     selecting that source. This is useful with low stratum sources
#     that are known to be unreliable or inaccurate and which should
#     be used only when other sources are unreachable.
#
#   version version
#     This option sets the NTP version of packets sent to the server.
#     This can be useful when the server runs an old NTP
#     implementation that does not respond to requests using a newer
#     version. The default version depends on whether a key is
#     specified by the key option and which authentication hash
#     function the key is using. If the output size of the hash
#     function is longer than 160 bits, the default version is 3 for
#     compatibility with older chronyd servers. Otherwise, the
#     default version is 4.
