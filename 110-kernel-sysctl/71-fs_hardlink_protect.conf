# Title:  Protect against creating/following links under certain conditions
# Description:
#
#   symlinks and hardlinks permit symlinks to be 
#   followed when outside of a world-writable sticky 
#   directory, when the owner of the symlink and 
#   follower match, or when the directory owner 
#   matches the symlink's owner. This also prevents 
#   hardlinks from being created by users that do not 
#   have read/write access to the source file. Both 
#   of these prevent many common TOCTOU races. 
#
#   FIFOs and regular files settings prevent creating 
#   files in potentially attacker-controlled 
#   environments, such as world-writable directories, 
#   to make data spoofing attacks more difficult.
