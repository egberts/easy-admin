Adding ZOnes

*.  Ask zone first, then view name, ( then view prompt then becomes optional)
*.  Ask for view first, then zone name?  <--- forces end-user to think POV

QQQ: Forcing User POV or ease of data-entry (possiblity of skipping view name)?

Got the list of 'view' via 'find'
VIEWS, select from

Now get a list of "pz.<zone-name>"  
ZONES, overwrite (Y/n)?

Do we find these zone files under /etc/bind[/instance]/primary
or at a more generalized /etc/bind[/instance] DIRSPEC?
