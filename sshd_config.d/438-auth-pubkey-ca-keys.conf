# TrustedUserCAKeys specifies a file containing public
# keys of certificate authorities that are trusted to
# sign user certificates for authentication, or none
# to not use one.  Keys are listed one per line; empty
# lines and comments starting with ‘#’ are allowed.
# If a certificate is presented for authentication and
# has its signing CA key listed in this file, then
# it may be used for authentication for any user
# listed in the certificate's principals list.
# NOTE: certificates that lack a list of principals
#       will not be permitted for authentication
#       using TrustedUserCAKeys.  For more details on
#       certificates, see the CERTIFICATES section
#       in ssh-keygen(1).
