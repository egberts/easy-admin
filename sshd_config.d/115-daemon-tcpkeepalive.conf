# TCPKeepAlive specifies whether the system should send
# TCP keepalive messages to the other side.  If they
# are sent, death of the connection or crash of one of
# the machines will be properly noticed.  However,
# this means that connections will die if the route is
# down temporarily, and some people find it annoying.
# On the other hand, if TCP keepalives are not sent,
# sessions may hang indefinitely on the server,
# leaving "ghost" users and consuming server resources.
#
# This option was formerly called KeepAlive.
# To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should
# be set to no.
#
# CLI option: -o
# Process context: main
# options.tcp_keep_alive/main()
# The default is yes (to send TCP keepalive messages),
# and the server will notice if the network goes down
# or the client host crashes.  This avoids infinitely
# hanging sessions.
