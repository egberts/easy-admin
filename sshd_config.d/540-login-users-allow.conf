# AllowUsers keyword can be followed by a list of user
# name patterns, separated by spaces.  If specified,
# login is allowed only for user names that match one
# of the patterns.  Only user names are valid; a
# numerical user ID is not recognized.  By default,
# login is allowed for all users.  If the pattern
# takes the form USER@HOST then USER and HOST are
# separately checked, restricting logins to particular
# users from particular hosts.  HOST criteria may
# additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR
# address/masklen format.  The allow/deny directives
# are processed in the following order: DenyUsers,
# AllowUsers, DenyGroups, and finally AllowGroups.
#
# CLI option: -o
# config.allow_users[]/allowed_user()
# AllowUsers default is not to use its keyword.
