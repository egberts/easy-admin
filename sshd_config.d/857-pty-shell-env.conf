# AcceptEnv specifies what environment variables sent
# by the client will be copied into the session's
# environ(7).  See SendEnv and SetEnv in ssh_config(5)
# for how to configure the client.  The TERM
# environ ment variable is always accepted whenever
# the client requests a pseudo-terminal as it is
# required by the protocol.  Variables are specified
# by name, which may contain the wildcard characters
# ‘*’ and ‘?’.  Multiple environment variables may be
# separated by whitespace or spread across multiple
# AcceptEnv directives.  Be warned that some
# environment variables could be used to bypass
# restricted user environments.  For this reason, care
# should be taken in the use of this directive.
#
# NOTE: Debian openssh-server package sets AcceptEnv
# option to 'LANG LC_*' as standard in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# which are not the default in sshd(8).
#
# CLI option: -o
# State: SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_REQ
# options.num_accept_env
# options.accept_env[]/session_env_req()/session_input_channel_req()/server_input_channel_req()
# AcceptEnv defaults to accept any environment variables.
