# RDomain specifies an explicit routing domain that is
# applied after authentication has completed.  The
# user session, as well and any forwarded or listening
# IP sockets, will be bound to this rdomain(4).  If
# the routing domain is set to %D, then the domain in
# which the incoming connection was received will be
# applied.
# RDomain accepts the token %D, 'none', or a valid domain.
#
# CLI option: -o
# Process context: main
# options.routing_domain/main()
