# SSH Session Method #1 - PseudoTTY
#---------------------------------------------------

# X11Forwarding specifies whether X11 forwarding is
# permitted.  The argument must be yes or no.
# The default is no.
#
# When X11 forwarding is enabled, there may be
# additional exposure to the server and to client
# displays if the sshd(8) proxy display is configured
# to listen on the wildcard address (see
# X11UseLocalhost), though this is not the default.
# Additionally, the authentication spoofing and
# authentication data verification and substitution
# occur on the client side.  The security risk of
# using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11
# display server may be exposed to attack when the SSH
# client requests forwarding (see the warnings for
# ForwardX11 in ssh_config(5)).  A system
# administrator may have a stance in which they want
# to protect clients that may expose themselves to
# attack by unwittingly requesting X11 forwarding,
# which can warrant a no setting.
#
# Note that disabling X11 forwarding does not prevent
# users from forwarding X11 traffic, as users can
# always install their own forwarders.
#
# NOTE: Debian openssh-server package sets X11Forwarding
# option to 'yes' as standard in # /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# which are not the default in sshd(8).
#
# CLI option: -o
# options.x11_forwarding/session_setup_x11fwd()
# X11Forwarding defaults to 'no'.
X11Forwarding no

# XAuthLocation specifies the full pathname of the
# xauth(1) program, or none to not use one.
#
# CLI option: -o
# do_rc_file()/session.c:1242
# options.xauth_location/session_setup_x11fwd()
# XAuthLocation defaults to '/usr/bin/xauth'.
XauthLocation /usr/bin/xauth

# X11DisplayOffset specifies the first display number
# available for sshd(8)'s X11 forwarding.  This prevents
# sshd from interfering with real X11 servers.
#
# CLI option: -o
# options.x11_display_offset/session_setup_x11fwd()
# X11DisplayOffset defaults to '10'.
X11DisplayOffset 10

# X11UseLocalhost specifies whether sshd(8) should bind
# the X11 forwarding server to the loopback address or
# to the wildcard address.  By default, sshd binds the
# forwarding server to the loopback address and sets
# the hostname part of the DISPLAY environment variable
# to localhost.  This prevents remote hosts from
# connecting to the proxy display.  However, some older
# X11 clients may not function with this configuration.
# X11UseLocalhost may be set to no to specify that the
# forwarding server should be bound to the wildcard
# address.  The argument must be yes or no.
#
# CLI option: -o
# options.x11_use_localhost/session_setup_x11fwd()
# X11UseLocalhost defaults to 'yes'.
X11UseLocalhost yes
