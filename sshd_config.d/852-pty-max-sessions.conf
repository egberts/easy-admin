# MaxSessions specifies the maximum number of open
# shell, login or subsystem (e.g. sftp) sessions
# permitted per network connection.  Multiple sessions
# may be established by clients that support connection
# multiplexing.  Setting MaxSessions to 1 will
# effectively disable session multiplexing, whereas
# setting it to 0 will prevent all shell, login and
# subsystem sessions while still permitting forwarding.
#
# No CLI option.
# options.max_sessions
# MaxSessions defaults to '10'.
MaxSessions 1
