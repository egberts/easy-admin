# UpdateHostKeys specifies whether ssh(1) should accept 
#    notifications of additional hostkeys from the 
#    server sent after authentication has completed and 
#    add them to UserKnownHostsFile.  The argument must
#    be yes, no (the default) or ask.  Enabling this 
#    option allows learning alternate hostkeys for a 
#    server and supports graceful key rotation by 
#    allowing a server to send replacement public keys 
#    before old ones are removed.  Additional hostkeys 
#    are only accepted if the key used to authenticate 
#    the host was already trusted or explicitly accepted 
#    by the user.  If UpdateHostKeys is set to ask, then 
#    the user is asked to confirm the modifications to 
#    the known_hosts file.  Confirmation is currently 
#    incompatible with ControlPersist, and will be 
#    disabled if it is enabled.
# 
# Presently, only sshd(8) from OpenSSH 6.8 and greater 
#    support the "hostkeys@openssh.com" protocol 
#    extension used to inform the client of all the 
#    server's hostkeys.
