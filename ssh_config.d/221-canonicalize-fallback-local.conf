# CanonicalizeFallbackLocal specifies whether to fail 
#    with an error when hostname canonicalization 
#    fails.  The default, yes, will attempt to look 
#    up the unqualified hostname using the system 
#    resolver's search rules.  A value of no will 
#    cause ssh(1) to fail instantly if 
#    CanonicalizeHostname is enabled and the target 
#    hostname cannot be found in any of the domains 
#    specified by CanonicalDomains.
#    Source: resolve_canonicalize()/ssh.c
CanonicalizeFallbackLocal yes
