# EscapeChar sets the escape character (default: ‘~’).  
#    The escape character can also be set on the 
#    command line.  The argument should be a single 
#    character, ‘^’ followed by a letter, or none to 
#    disable the escape character entirely (making the 
#    connection transparent for binary data).
