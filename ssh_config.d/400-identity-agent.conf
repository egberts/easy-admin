# IdentityAgent specifies the UNIX-domain socket used 
#    to communicate with the authentication agent.
#
#    This option overrides the SSH_AUTH_SOCK 
#    environment variable and can be used to select a 
#    specific agent.  Setting the socket name to none 
#    disables the use of an authentication agent.  If 
#    the string "SSH_AUTH_SOCK" is specified, the 
#    location of the socket will be read from the 
#    SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable.  Otherwise 
#    if the specified value begins with a ‘$’ 
#    character, then it will be treated as an 
#    environment variable containing the location of 
#    the socket.
#
#    Arguments to IdentityAgent may use the tilde 
#    syntax to refer to a user's home directory or
#    the tokens described in the TOKENS section.
