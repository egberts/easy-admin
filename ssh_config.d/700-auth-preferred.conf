# PreferredAuthentications specifies the order in 
#     which the client should try authentication 
#     methods.  This allows a client to prefer one 
#     method (e.g.  keyboard-interactive) over 
#     another method (e.g. password).  The default 
#     is:
#
#     gssapi-with-mic,hostbased,publickey,
#     keyboard-interactive,password
#
#     Source: options.preferred_authentication/ssh_userauth2()/ssh_login()/sshconnect2.c
