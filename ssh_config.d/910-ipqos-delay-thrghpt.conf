# IPQoS specifies the IPv4 type-of-service or DSCP 
#    class for connections.  
#    Accepted values are 
#    af11, af12, af13, af21, af22, af23, af31, af32, 
#    af33, af41, af42, af43, cs0, cs1, cs2, cs3, cs4, 
#    cs5, cs6, cs7, ef, lowdelay, throughput, 
#    reliability, a numeric value, or none to use 
#    the operating system default.  
#    This option may take one or two arguments, 
#    separated by whitespace.  
#    If one argument is specified, it is used as the 
#    packet class unconditionally.  
#    If two values are specified, the first is 
#    automatically selected for interactive sessions 
#    and the second for non-interactive sessions.  
#    The default is lowdelay for interactive sessions 
#    and throughput for non-interactive sessions.
