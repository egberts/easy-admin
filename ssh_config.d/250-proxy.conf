# ProxyJump specifies one or more jump proxies as 
#    either [user@]host[:port] or an ssh URI.  
#    Multiple proxies may be separated by comma 
#    characters and will be visited sequentially.  
#    Setting this option will cause ssh(1) to connect 
#    to the target host by first making a ssh(1) 
#    connection to the specified ProxyJump host and 
#    then establishing a TCP forwarding to the 
#    ultimate target from there.
#
#    Note that this option will compete with the 
#    ProxyCommand option - whichever is specified 
#    first will prevent later instances of the other 
#    from taking effect.
#    NOTE: ProxyCommand is ignored if ProxyJump 
#          already specified.

# ProxyUseFdpass specifies that ProxyCommand will 
#    pass a connected file descriptor back to 
#    ssh(1) instead of continuing to execute and 
#    pass data.  The default is no.
