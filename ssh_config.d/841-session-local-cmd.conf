# LocalCommand specifies a command to execute on the 
#    local machine after successfully connecting to 
#    the server.  The command string extends to the 
#    end of the line, and is executed with the user's 
#    shell.  Arguments to LocalCommand accept the 
#    tokens described in the TOKENS section.
#
#    The command is run synchronously and does not 
#    have access to the session of the ssh(1) that 
#    spawned it.  It should not be used for 
#    interactive commands.
#
#    This directive is ignored unless 
#    PermitLocalCommand has been enabled.
