# AddKeysToAgent specifies whether keys should be 
#    automatically added to a running ssh-agent(1).  
#    If this option is set to yes and a key is loaded 
#    from a file, the key and its passphrase are 
#    added to the agent with the default lifetime, as 
#    if by ssh-add(1).  If this option is set to ask, 
#    ssh(1) will require confirmation using the 
#    SSH_ASKPASS program before adding a key (see 
#    ssh-add(1) for details).  If this option is set 
#    to confirm, each use of the key must be 
#    confirmed, as if the -c option was specified to 
#    ssh-add(1).  If this option is set to no, no 
#    keys are added to the agent.  
#    The argument must be yes, confirm, ask, or 
#    no (the default).
