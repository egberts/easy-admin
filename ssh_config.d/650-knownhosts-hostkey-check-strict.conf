# StrictHostKeyChecking, if this flag is set to yes, 
#    ssh(1) will never automatically add host keys to 
#    the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, and refuses to 
#    connect to hosts whose host key has changed.  
#    This provides maximum protection against 
#    man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, though it can 
#    be annoying when the /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts 
#    file is poorly maintained or when connections 
#    to new hosts are frequently made.  This option 
#    forces the user to manually add all new hosts.
#
#    If this flag is set to “accept-new” then ssh 
#    will automatically add new host keys to the user 
#    known hosts files, but will not permit 
#    connections to hosts with changed host keys.  
#    If this flag is set to “no” or “off”, ssh will 
#    automatically add new host keys to the user 
#    known hosts files and allow connections to hosts 
#    with changed hostkeys to proceed, subject to 
#    some restrictions.  
#    If this flag is set to ask (the default), new 
#    host keys will be added to the user known host 
#    files only after the user has confirmed that is 
#    what they really want to do, and ssh will refuse 
#    to connect to hosts whose host key has changed.  
#    The host keys of known hosts will be verified 
#    automatically in all cases.
