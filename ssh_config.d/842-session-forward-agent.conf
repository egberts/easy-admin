# ForwardAgent specifies whether the connection to 
#    the authentication agent (if any) will be 
#    forwarded to the remote machine.  
#    The argument must be yes or no (the default).
# 
#    Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  
#    Users with the ability to bypass file 
#    permissions on the remote host (for the agent's 
#    UNIX-domain socket) can access the local agent 
#    through the forwarded connection.  An attacker 
#    cannot obtain key material from the agent, 
#    however they can perform operations on the keys 
#    that enable them to authenticate using the 
#    identities loaded into the agent.
