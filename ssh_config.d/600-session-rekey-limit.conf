# RekeyLimit specifies the maximum amount of data that 
#    may be transmitted before the session key is 
#    renegotiated, optionally followed a maximum 
#    amount of time that may pass before the session 
#    key is renegotiated.  The first argument is 
#    specified in bytes and may have a suffix of ‘K’, 
#    ‘M’, or ‘G’ to indicate Kilobytes, Megabytes, or 
#    Gigabytes, respectively.  The default is between 
#    ‘1G’ and ‘4G’, depending on the cipher.  
#    The optional second value is specified in 
#    seconds and may use any of the units documented 
#    in the TIME FORMATS section of sshd_config(5).  
#    The default value for RekeyLimit is default 
#    none, which means that rekeying is performed 
#    after the cipher's default amount of data has 
#    been sent or received and no time based 
#    rekeying is done.
