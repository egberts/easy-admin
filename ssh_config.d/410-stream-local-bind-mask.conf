# StreamLocalBindMask sets the octal file creation 
#    mode mask (umask) used when creating a 
#    UNIX-domain socket file for local or remote port 
#    forwarding.  This option is only used for port 
#    forwarding to a UNIX-domain socket file.
#
#    The default value is 0177, which creates a 
#    UNIX-domain socket file that is readable and 
#    writable only by the owner.  Note that not all 
#    operating systems honor the file mode on 
#    UNIX-domain socket files.
