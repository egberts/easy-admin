# IdentityFile specifies a file from which the user's 
#    DSA, ECDSA, Ed25519 or RSA authentication 
#    identity is read.  
#    The default are all:
#        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa
#        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
#        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
#        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
#    Additionally, any identities represented by the 
#    authentication agent will be used for 
#    authentication unless IdentitiesOnly is set.  
#    If no certificates have been explicitly 
#    specified by CertificateFile, ssh(1) will try to 
#    load certificate information from the filename 
#    obtained by appending -cert.pub to the path of a 
#    specified IdentityFile.
#
#    Arguments to IdentityFile may use the tilde 
#    syntax to refer to a user's home directory or 
#    the tokens described in the TOKENS section.
#
#    It is possible to have multiple identity files 
#    specified in configuration files; all these 
#    identities will be tried in sequence.  Multiple 
#    IdentityFile directives will add to the list of 
#    identities tried (this behaviour differs from 
#    that of other configuration directives).
