# ClearAllForwardings specifies that all local, 
#    remote, and dynamic port forwardings specified 
#    in the configuration files or on the command 
#    line be cleared.  This option is primarily 
#    useful when used from the ssh(1) command line to 
#    clear port forwardings set in configuration 
#    files, and is automatically set by scp(1) and 
#    sftp(1).  
#    The argument must be yes or no (the default).
