# ForwardX11 specifies whether X11 connections will 
#    be automatically redirected over the secure 
#    channel and DISPLAY set.  
#    The argument must be yes or no (the default).
#
#    X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  
#    Users with the ability to bypass file 
#    permissions on the remote host (for the user's 
#    X11 authorization database) can access the 
#    local X11 display through the forwarded 
#    connection.  
#    An attacker may then be able to perform 
#    activities such as keystroke monitoring if the 
#    ForwardX11Trusted option is also enabled.
#    Source: options.forward_x11/ssh_session2_setup()/channel_register_open_confirm()/ssh_session2_open()/ssh_session2()/main()/sshconnect.c
# ForwardX11 no  # default
ForwardX11 no

# XAuthLocation specifies the full pathname of the 
#    xauth(1) program.  The default is /usr/bin/xauth.
#    Source: options.xauth_location/ssh_session2_setup()/channel_register_open_confirm()/ssh_session2_open()/ssh_session2()/main()/sshconnect.c
XAuthLocation /usr/bin/xauth

# ForwardX11Trusted, if this option is set to yes, 
#    (the Debian-specific default), remote X11 
#    clients will have full access to the original 
#    X11 display.
#
#    If this option is set to no (the upstream default), 
#    remote X11 clients will be considered untrusted 
#    and prevented from stealing or tampering with 
#    data belonging to trusted X11 clients.  
#    Furthermore, the xauth(1) token used for the 
#    session will be set to expire after 20 minutes.  
#    Remote clients will be refused access after 
#    this time.
#
#    See the X11 SECURITY extension specification for 
#    full details on the restrictions imposed on 
#    untrusted clients.

# ForwardX11Trusted yes  # Debian-default
# ForwardX11Trusted no  # maintainer-default
ForwardX11Trusted yes

# ForwardX11Timeout specify a timeout for untrusted 
#    X11 forwarding using the format described in the 
#    TIME FORMATS section of sshd_config(5).  
#    X11 connections received by ssh(1) after this 
#    time will be refused.  Setting ForwardX11Timeout 
#    to zero will disable the timeout and permit X11 
#    forwarding for the life of the connection.  
#    The default is to disable untrusted X11 
#    forwarding after twenty minutes has elapsed.
#    Source: options.forward_x11_timeout/ssh_session2_setup()/channel_register_open_confirm()/ssh_session2_open()/ssh_session2()/main()/sshconnect.c
ForwardX11Timeout 1200
