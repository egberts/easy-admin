# CanonicalizeHostname controls whether explicit 
#    hostname canonicalization is performed.  
#    The default, no, is not to perform any name 
#    rewriting and let the system resolver handle all 
#    hostname lookups.  If set to yes then, for 
#    connections that do not use a ProxyCommand or 
#    ProxyJump, ssh(1) will attempt to canonicalize 
#    the hostname specified on the command line using 
#    the CanonicalDomains suffixes and 
#    CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs rules.  
#    If CanonicalizeHostname is set to always, then 
#    canonicalization is applied to proxied 
#    connections too.
