# ProxyCommand specifies the command to use to 
#    connect to the server.  The command string 
#    extends to the end of the line, and is executed 
#    using the user's shell ‘exec’ directive to avoid 
#    a lingering shell process.
#
#    Arguments to ProxyCommand accept the tokens 
#    described in the TOKENS section.  The command 
#    can be basically anything, and should read from 
#    its standard input and write to its standard 
#    output.  It should eventually connect an sshd(8) 
#    server running on some machine, or execute 
#    sshd -i somewhere.  Host key management will be 
#    done using the HostName of the host being 
#    connected (defaulting to the name typed by the 
#    user).  Setting the command to none disables 
#    this option entirely.  Note that CheckHostIP is 
#    not available for connects with a proxy command.
#    NOTE: Ignore ProxyCommand if ProxyJump already 
#          specified.
#
#    This directive is useful in conjunction with 
#    nc(1) and its proxy support.  For example, the 
#    following directive would connect via an HTTP 
#    proxy at 192.0.2.0:
#
#        ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -X connect -x 192.0.2.0:8080 %h %p
#        ProxyCommand ssh -q -W %h:%p gateway.example.com
#    Source: main()/ssh.c
