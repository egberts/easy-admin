# HashKnownHosts indicates that ssh(1) should hash 
#    host names and addresses when they are added to 
#    ~/.ssh/known_hosts.  These hashed names may be 
#    used normally by ssh(1) and sshd(8), but they do 
#    not reveal identifying information should the 
#    file's contents be disclosed.  
#    The default is no.  
#    Note that existing names and addresses in known 
#    hosts files will not be converted automatically, 
#    but may be manually hashed using ssh-keygen(1).  
#    Use of this option may break facilities such as 
#    tab-completion that rely on being able to read 
#    unhashed host names from ~/.ssh/known_hosts.
