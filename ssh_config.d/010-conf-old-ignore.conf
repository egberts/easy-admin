# IgnoreUnknown specifies a pattern-list of unknown 
#    options to be ignored if they are encountered 
#    in configuration parsing.  
#    This may be used to suppress errors if 
#    ssh_config contains options that are unrecognised 
#    by ssh(1).  
#    It is recommended that IgnoreUnknown be listed 
#    early in the configuration file as it will not 
#    be applied to unknown options that appear 
#    before it.
