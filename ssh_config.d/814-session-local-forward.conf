# LocalForward specifies that a TCP port on the local 
#    machine be forwarded over the secure channel to 
#    the specified host and port from the remote 
#    machine.  The first argument must be 
#    [bind_address:]port and the second argument must 
#    be host:hostport.  IPv6 addresses can be 
#    specified by enclosing addresses in square 
#    brackets.  Multiple forwardings may be 
#    specified, and additional forwardings can be 
#    given on the command line.  Only the superuser 
#    can forward privileged ports.  By default, the 
#    local port is bound in accordance with the 
#    GatewayPorts setting.  However, an explicit 
#    bind_address may be used to bind the connection 
#    to a specific address.  The bind_address of 
#    localhost indicates that the listening port be 
#    bound for local use only, while an empty address 
#    or ‘*’ indicates that the port should be 
#    available from all interfaces.
