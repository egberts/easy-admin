# BatchMode, if set to yes, passphrase/password 
#    querying will be disabled.  In addition, the 
#    ServerAliveInterval option will be set to 300 
#    seconds by default (Debian-specific).  This 
#    option is useful in scripts and other batch jobs 
#    where no user is present to supply the password, 
#    and where it is desirable to detect a broken 
#    network swiftly.  The argument must be yes or 
#    no (the default).
