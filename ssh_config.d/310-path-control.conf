# ControlPath specify the path to the control socket 
#    used for connection sharing as described in the 
#    ControlMaster section above or the string none 
#    to disable connection sharing.  Arguments to 
#    ControlPath may use the tilde syntax to refer to 
#    a user's home directory or the tokens described 
#    in the TOKENS section.  It is recommended that 
#    any ControlPath used for opportunistic 
#    connection sharing include at least %h, %p, and 
#    %r (or alternatively %C) and be placed in a 
#    directory that is not writable by other users.  
#    This ensures that shared connections are 
#    uniquely identified.
