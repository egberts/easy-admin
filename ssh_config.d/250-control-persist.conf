# ControlPersist, when used in conjunction with 
#    ControlMaster, specifies that the master 
#    connection should remain open in the background 
#    (waiting for future client connections) after 
#    the initial client connection has been closed.  
#    If set to no, then the master connection will 
#    not be placed into the background, and will 
#    close as soon as the initial client connection 
#    is closed.  If set to yes or 0, then the master 
#    connection will remain in the background 
#    indefinitely (until killed or closed via a 
#    mechanism such as the "ssh -O exit").  If set to 
#    a time in seconds, or a time in any of the 
#    formats documented in sshd_config(5), then the 
#    backgrounded master connection will 
#    automatically terminate after it has remained 
#    idle (with no client connections) for the 
#    specified time.  (ssh_session2()/ssh.c)
