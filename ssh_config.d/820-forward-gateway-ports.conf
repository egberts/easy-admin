# GatewayPorts specifies whether remote hosts are 
#    allowed to connect to local forwarded ports.  
#    By default, ssh(1) binds local port forwardings 
#    to the loopback address.  This prevents other 
#    remote hosts from connecting to forwarded ports.  
#    GatewayPorts can be used to specify that ssh 
#    should bind local port forwardings to the 
#    wildcard address, thus allowing remote hosts to 
#    connect to forwarded ports.  
#    The argument must be yes or no (the default).
