# ExitOnForwardFailure specifies whether ssh(1) 
#    should terminate the connection if it cannot set 
#    up all requested dynamic, tunnel, local, and 
#    remote port forwardings, (e.g. if either end is 
#    unable to bind and listen on a specified port).  
#    Note that ExitOnForwardFailure does not apply to 
#    connections made over port forwardings and will 
#    not, for example, cause ssh(1) to exit if TCP 
#    connections to the ultimate forwarding 
#    destination fail.  The argument must be yes or 
#    no (the default).  
#    Source: options.exit_on_fwd_failure/ssh_init_forwarding()/ssh_session2()/main()/ssh.c)
