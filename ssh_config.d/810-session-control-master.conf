# ControlMaster enables the sharing of multiple 
#     sessions over a single network connection. 
#     When set to yes, ssh(1) will listen for 
#     connections on a control socket specified using 
#     the ControlPath argument. Additional sessions 
#     can connect to this socket using the same 
#     ControlPath with ControlMaster set to no (the 
#     default). These sessions will try to reuse the 
#     master instance's network connection rather 
#     than initiating new ones, but will fall back 
#     to connecting normally if the control socket 
#     does not exist, or is not listening.
#
#     Setting this to ask will cause ssh(1) to listen 
#     for control connections, but require 
#     confirmation using ssh-askpass(1). If the 
#     ControlPath cannot be opened, ssh(1) will 
#     continue without connecting to a master 
#     instance.
#
#     X11 and ssh-agent(1) forwarding is supported 
#     over these multiplexed connections, however the 
#     display and agent forwarded will be the one 
#     belonging to the master connection i.e. it is 
#     not possible to forward multiple displays or 
#     agents.
#
#     Two additional options allow for opportunistic 
#     multiplexing: try to use a master connection 
#     but fall back to creating a new one if one does 
#     not already exist. These options are: auto and 
#     autoask. The latter requires confirmation like 
#     the ask option.
#
#     NOTE:  'MaxSession 1' disables ControlMaster
