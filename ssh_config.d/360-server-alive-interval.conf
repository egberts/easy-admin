# ServerAliveInterval sets a timeout interval in 
#    seconds after which if no data has been received 
#    from the server, ssh(1) will send a message 
#    through the encrypted channel to request a 
#    response from the server.  The default is 0, 
#    indicating that these messages will not be sent 
#    to the server, or 300 if the BatchMode option is 
#    set (Debian-specific).  ProtocolKeepAlives and 
#    SetupTimeOut are Debian-specific compatibility 
#    aliases for this option.
# ServerAliveInterval 0  # default 0
