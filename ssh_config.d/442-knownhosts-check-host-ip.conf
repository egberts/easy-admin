# CheckHostIP, if set to yes (the default), ssh(1) 
#    will additionally check the host IP address in 
#    the known_hosts file.  This allows it to detect 
#    if a host key changed due to DNS spoofing and 
#    will add addresses of destination hosts to 
#    ~/.ssh/known_hosts in the process, regardless of 
#    the setting of StrictHostKeyChecking.  
#    If the option is set to no, the check will not 
#    be executed.
#    NOTE: CheckHostIP is disabled if connected to 
#          localhost only VIA PROXY.
