# ServerAliveCountMax sets the number of server alive 
#    messages (see below) which may be sent without 
#    ssh(1) receiving any messages back from the 
#    server.  If this threshold is reached while 
#    server alive messages are being sent, ssh will 
#    disconnect from the server, terminating the 
#    session.  It is important to note that the use 
#    of server alive messages is very different from 
#    TCPKeepAlive (below).  The server alive messages 
#    are sent through the encrypted channel and 
#    therefore will not be spoofable.  The TCP 
#    keepalive option enabled by TCPKeepAlive is 
#    spoofable.  The server alive mechanism is 
#    valuable when the client or server depend on 
#    knowing when a connection has become inactive.
#
#    The default value is 3.  If, for example, 
#    ServerAliveInterval (see below) is set to 15 
#    and ServerAliveCountMax is left at the default, 
#    if the server becomes unresponsive, ssh will 
#    disconnect after approximately 45 seconds.
# ServerAliveCountMax 3  # default
ServerAliveCountMax 3
