# Title: Rules file for state-less firewall-to-firewall communication
# Description:
#
#   in ?SECTION ALL, this is the first set of rule encountered in a firewall chain
#   before any connection tracking state.
#
#   Before ESTABLISHED, NEW, INVALID, RELATED, UNTRACKED states, this
#   file covers the firewall-to-firewall (loopback to loopback) network traffic.
#
#   Useful for blocking some admin tools made easily available to end-users
#   such as 'chronyc' or ISC Bind 'rndc'.

#ACTION		SOURCE		DEST		PROTO	DEST	SOURCE		ORIGINAL	RATE		USER/	MARK	CONNLIMIT	TIME		HEADERS		SWITCH		HELPER
