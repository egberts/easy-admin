# Title: Rules File for three-interface configuration.
# Description:
#
#   ?SECTION UNTRACKED
#
#   Added in Shorewall 4.5.13. Packets in the UNTRACKED state are
#   processed by rules in this section.
#   
#   The only Actions allowed in this section are ACCEPT, DROP, REJECT,
#   LOG, NFLOG, NFQUEUE and QUEUE.
#   
#   There is an implicit rule added at the end of this section that
#   invokes the UNTRACKED_DISPOSITION (shorewall.conf[2](5)).
#
#   Wolfe's note:  
#    1. Never a good idea to move rules between sections. (unless you know)
#    2. It is safe to organized by source-dest, as long as ordering within
#       those matching tuple is still being maintained
#    3. sub-chains go at the end of each sub-section
#
#   See following for further details.
