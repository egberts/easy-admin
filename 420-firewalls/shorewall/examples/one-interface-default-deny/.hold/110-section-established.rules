#     LOG, NFLOG, NFQUEUE and QUEUE
#     
#     There is an implicit ACCEPT rule inserted at the end of this
#     section.
#
#   Wolfe's note:  
#    1. Never a good idea to move rules between sections. (unless you know)
#    2. It is safe to organized by source-dest, as long as ordering within
#       those matching tuple is still being maintained
#    3. sub-chains go at the end of each sub-section
#
#   See following for further details.
