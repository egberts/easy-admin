# Title: Rules File for three-interface configuration.
# Description:
#   ?SECTION ALL
#   This section was added in Shorewall 4.4.23. Rules in this section
#   are applied, regardless of the connection tracking state of the
#   packet and are applied before rules in the other sections.
#
#   Wolfe's note:  
#    1. Never a good idea to move rules between sections. (unless you know)
#    2. It is safe to organized by source-dest, as long as ordering within
#       those matching tuple is still being maintained
#    3. sub-chains go at the end of each sub-section
#
#   See following for further details.
