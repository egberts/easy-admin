# Title: Rules File for three-interface configuration.
# Description:
#
#   ?SECTION RELATED
#
#   Packets in the RELATED state are processed by rules in this
#   section.
#   
#   The only ACTIONs allowed in this section are ACCEPT, DROP, REJECT,
#   LOG, NFLOG, NFQUEUE and QUEUE
#   
#   There is an implicit rule added at the end of this section that
#   invokes the RELATED_DISPOSITION (shorewall.conf[2](5)).
#
#   Wolfe's note:  
#    1. Never a good idea to move rules between sections. (unless you know)
#    2. It is safe to organized by source-dest, as long as ordering within
#       those matching tuple is still being maintained
#    3. sub-chains go at the end of each sub-section
#
#   See following for further details.
