# findgw
#
# Description: This script is invoked when Shorewall is attempting 
# to discover the gateway through a dynamic interface. The script 
# is most often used when the interface is managed by dhclient 
# which has no standardized location/name for its lease database. 
# Scripts for use with dhclient on several distributions are 
# available at http://www.shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/contrib/findgw/
#
#  $1 - Ethernet interface
#
# State: run-time
# Action: Done at detect_dynamic_gateway()/lib.runtime
# Allowable pragma: '?INCLUDE' statement

# Action: done at DHCLIENT time?
