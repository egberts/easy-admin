# isusable
#
# Description: invoked when Shorewall is trying to determine the 
#    usability of the network interface associated with an 
#    optional entry in /etc/shorewall/providers. $1 is the name 
#    of the interface which will have been determined to be up 
#    and configured before the script is invoked. The return 
#    value from the script indicates whether or not the 
#    interface is usable (0 = usable, other = unusable).
# Example:

# Ping a gateway through the passed interface:
# case $1 in
#     eth0)
#         ping -c 4 -t 1 -I eth0 206.124.146.254 > /dev/null 2>&1
#         return
#         ;;
#     eth1)
#         ping -c 4 -t 1 -I eth1 192.168.12.254 > /dev/null 2>&1
#         return
#         ;;
#     *)
#         # No additional testing of other interfaces
#         return 0
#         ;;
# esac
# 
# Caution
# 
# We recommend that this script only be used with ADMINISABSENTMINDED=Yes.
# 
# The firewall state when this script is invoked is indeterminate. 
# So if you have ADMINISABSENTMINDED=No in shorewall.conf(8) and 
# output on an interface is not allowed by stoppedrules(8) then 
# the isuasable script must blow it's own holes in the firewall 
# before probing.
#
# State: run-time
# Action: done at shorewall 'refresh, restart, restore, start'
